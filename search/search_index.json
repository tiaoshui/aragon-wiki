DEMOCRATIZING GOVERNANCE The first step towards a more fair, efficient world We are building Aragon because we believe decentralized organizations can solve the world\u2019s worst problems . Aragon is a project that aims to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of organizational structures by using blockchain technology. We want to empower people across the world to easily and securely manage their organizations. We provide the tools for anyone to become an entrepreneur and run their own organization, to take control of their own lives. By making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, we are enabling a borderless, permissionless and more efficient creation of value. GOODBYE UNNECESSARY INTERMEDIARIES Reclaim your independence Aragon organizations are powered by Ethereum, a global blockchain for running unstoppable applications. In Ethereum, code and applications always run without any possibility of downtime or censorship. Blockchain technology provides a single shared source of cryptographically verified truth. This is secured by a network made up of thousands of computers all over the globe. Anyone can set up their own node where all the necessary data is replicated across the network. This decentralized design ensures a borderless and permissionless way of operating, without the fear of a government or a malicious third-party interfering. IMAGINE A NATION WITHOUT LAND AND BORDERS A digital jurisdiction Aragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction, an online decentralized court system that isn\u2019t bound by traditional artificial barriers such as national jurisdictions or the borders of a single country. Aragon organizations can be upgraded seamlessly using our aragonOS architecture. They can solve disputes between two parties by using the decentralized court system, a digital jurisdiction that operates only online and utilizes your peers to resolve issues. The Aragon Network Token, ANT, puts the power into the hands of the people participating in the operation of the Network. Every single aspect of the Network will be governed by those willing to make an effort for a better future.","title":"\u6b22\u8fce"},{"location":"#_1","text":"We believe decentralized organizations can solve the world\u2019s worst problems .
