For our website visit aragon.org . What is Aragon? DEMOCRATIZING GOVERNANCE The first step towards a more fair, efficient world We are building Aragon because we believe decentralized organizations can solve the world\u2019s worst problems . Aragon is a project that aims to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of organizational structures by using blockchain technology. We want to empower people across the world to easily and securely manage their organizations. We provide the tools for anyone to become an entrepreneur and run their own organization, to take control of their own lives. By making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, we are enabling a borderless, permissionless and more efficient creation of value. GOODBYE UNNECESSARY INTERMEDIARIES Reclaim your independence Aragon organizations are powered by Ethereum, a global blockchain for running unstoppable applications. In Ethereum, code and applications always run without any possibility of downtime or censorship. Blockchain technology provides a single shared source of cryptographically verified truth. This is secured by a network made up of thousands of computers all over the globe. Anyone can set up their own node where all the necessary data is replicated across the network. This decentralized design ensures a borderless and permissionless way of operating, without the fear of a government or a malicious third-party interfering. IMAGINE A NATION WITHOUT LAND AND BORDERS A digital jurisdiction Aragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction, an online decentralized court system that isn\u2019t bound by traditional artificial barriers such as national jurisdictions or the borders of a single country. Aragon organizations can be upgraded seamlessly using our aragonOS architecture. They can solve disputes between two parties by using the decentralized court system, a digital jurisdiction that operates only online and utilizes your peers to resolve issues. The Aragon Network Token, ANT, puts the power into the hands of the people participating in the operation of the Network. Every single aspect of the Network will be governed by those willing to make an effort for a better future. Aragon client Decentralized application to run your organization TRANSFER TOKENS Tokens represent your stake in the organization Your organization is in control of its funds. Transfer and assign them according to your personal needs without artificial limitations. FUNDRAISING Grasp the potential of a new form of crowdfunding Utilize the power of the crowd for funding and raise funds globally, in private or publicly, without relying on banks or financial gatekeepers. VOTING Decision-making by voting Use voting for more effective results. Votes are a secure, transparent and unforgeable way to come to a decision on major issues. PAYMENTS Instant payments in a few clicks Adding a new employee to your organization and payroll is as easy as creating a new recurring payment. ACCOUNTING Tamper-proof, effective accounting Every transaction is recorded and can be verified on the blockchain at any given time Unprecedented level of transparency can be gained through the use of a public blockchain to engrave every entry permanently on the ledger. Pre-established rules can automatically define your quarterly spending and budgeting. PERMISSIONS Flexible and resilient privilege escalation Fine-grained permissions deliver the freedom to create an organization that will work for you. Permissions can be granular and assigned in fine detail. You can choose to give people a certain degree of control over the organization and privileges can be escalated easily through a voting or different mechanisms if the person isn't allowed to directly perform a desired action. By assigning different permissions to people, you can create the kind of organizational structure that is best suited for your needs. Aragon Network Ensuring the success of decentralized organizations Putting the power back into the hands of the users The Aragon Network will decentralize its governance by gradually handing over control of the project to its users. The Aragon Network will establish additional services for the organizations taking advantage of what Aragon provides. Our mission is to make the Aragon Network an autonomous organization itself, which is managed by the people using it for their mutual prosperity. ARAGON GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS Join us in improving Aragon by making your voice heard Aragon Governance Proposals is a system for community members to join the discussion and create proposals affecting Aragon. Everyone is welcome to join in and aid in forging the future of how Aragon will shape out to be. Together we can build the exciting future we want to see. Why Aragon? Aragon was born to bring transparency and independent governance to the forefront of managing an organization. We want to give the users the freedom they deserve to run their lives. Organizations like companies exist to create value for their owners and users. They use the resources available to them in order to provide services and to create products. Their ability to do this efficiently is hindered by factors outside of their influence. By removing unnecessary intermediaries and third parties that impose artificial restrictions and unnecessarily complex regulations, we can modernize the way organizations are run. OUR VISION Evolution of the internet and blockchain technology are changing the ways we interact with each other We believe that the progression of modern technology solutions, such as the invention of the blockchain, are changing the incentives for people to interact with each other. We are building the tools for the next generation of organizations to take advantage of this revolution. Experimenting with new governance models has been a very risky endeavour during previous iterations of society. Now, for the first time in human history, we can let a thousand new governance models emerge, all from the comfort of our laptops.

Updated Jan. 14th, 2018. An exokernel -inspired architecture for modular, upgradeable, and secure DAOs Introduction This exokernel-inspired architecture enables modular, upgradeable, and secure Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It implements a UNIX-inspired permissioning system with smart contracts to allow for safe and efficient control over software resources. Smart contracts, an essential component of the Ethereum ecosystem, can define the rules and penalties around an agreement. They can also make decisions and enforce prior commitments, such as transfering large amounts of funds. However, such significant responsibilities make smart contracts a prime target for attacks. Testing and auditing them are not absolute remedies because, inevitably, humans make mistakes. So, how does one guarantee DAOs that run efficiently and securely? And how do we provide upgrading capabilities to these DAOs, to ensure the safety and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem? We present our secure decentralized operating system: aragonOS . This document provides a technical overview about the architecture. For a less technically-oriented introduction to aragonOS, you can check the announcement blog post . 1. Kernel and the Access Control List The Access Control List (ACL) is the filter which determines whether an entity has a certain role in the context of an app. It either permits or prohibits performing actions, such as an update, in a given context, as well as determining the entities with power over that permission. The ACL permissioning system is inspired by UNIX. ACLs control the permissions afforded to a user in the system and can ease the transfer of said permissions. Similar to the sudo command in UNIX, users can escalate permissions, but with more flexibility and granularity. A reference implementation of the Kernel and its ACL can be found here: Kernel.sol . Apps and Actions App s are smart contracts that rely on the Kernel\u2014the core of the operating system\u2014for maintaining their ACL and upgrading their code. Apps can interact with users and other smart contracts by implementing Action s, where each action is a publicly-accessible function that may or may not be protected by the ACL. Any actions that are protected are only allowed to be executed if the caller is permitted by the ACL. Because apps are upgradeable, we expect them to exist for a long period of time and be safely responsible for owning assets on behalf of the DAO (e.g. tokens and ENS names). App instances are identified by their deployed Ethereum addresses. More than one instance of a particular app can be installed in a DAO at a time (e.g. multiple Token Manager instances can be installed to control multiple tokens). Roles Another feature in ensuring security within the ecosystem is the ease of delegating responsibilities for autonomous execution. Apps can define any number of Role s, where each role grants access to one or more of the app's actions as part of the app's ACL. Any entity wishing to perform an action protected by the ACL must have the necessary permissions by having a role that is capable of executing that action. Roles are always unique to each app. Having a given role in one app does not grant the permission to perform that same role in other apps. An entity can have many roles in one app. Example: contract TokenApp is App { bytes32 constant public MINT_ROLE = 0x1234; function mint(address _receiver, uint256 _amount) auth(MINT_ROLE) { \u2026 } } TokenApp is an app that defines one action, mint() , whose execution is controlled by MINT_ROLE . Entity An Entity is any actor that is represented by an Ethereum address, such as a multisig (an account that needs multiple signatures before executing an action), an app (for example, a voting app that only executes an action if token holders vote favorably), or a simple private key controlled account. The system can delegate permissions to groups of entities by implementing a Group app. As in other apps, it can rely on the ACL for protecting important functions, such as adding or removing members of the group. When group members want to execute a specific action, the Group app acts as a proxy contract that performs the action on behalf of the group. Permissions A Permission is defined as the ability to perform actions (grouped by roles) in a certain app instance (identified by its address). We refer to a Permission Instance as an entity holding a certain permission. When a permission is created, a Permission Manager is set for that specific permission. The permission manager is able to grant or revoke permission instances for that permission. Create Permission kernel.createPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role, address manager) createPermission() will fail if that permission has pre-existing permission instances. This action is identical to grantPermission() except it allows the creation of a new permission if it doesn\u2019t exist yet. A role in the ACL protects access to createPermission() as this important function could be used in malicious ways. When the Kernel is initialized, it also creates the permission that grants the initializing address the ability to create new permissions. Note that creating permissions is made mandatory by the ACL: all actions requiring yet-to-be-created permissions are disallowed by default. Any permission checks on non-existent permissions are failed automatically. Grant Permission kernel.grantPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role) Grants role in app for an entity . Only callable by the manager of a certain permission. This entity would then be allowed to call all actions that their role can perform on that particular app until the permission manager revokes their role with revokePermission() . The grantPermission() action doesn\u2019t require protection with the ACL because an entity can only make changes to a permission if it is the permission's manager . Revoke Permission kernel.revokePermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role) Revokes role in app for an entity . Only callable by the manager of a certain permission. The revokePermission() action doesn\u2019t need to be protected by the ACL either, as an entity can only make changes if it is the manager for a given permission. Set Permission Manager kernel.setPermissionManager(address newManager, address app, bytes32 role) Changes the permission manager to newManager . Only callable by the manager of a certain permission. The new permission manager replaces the old permission manager, resulting in the old manager losing any management power over that permission. createPermission() executes a special case of this action to set the initial manager for the newly created permission. From that point forward, the manager can only be changed with setPermissionManager() . Events createPermission() , grantPermission() , and revokePermission() all fire the same SetPermission event that Aragon clients are expected to cache and process into a locally stored version of the ACL: SetPermission(address indexed from, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed to, bool allowed) setPermissionManager() fires the following event: ChangePermissionManager(address indexed app, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed manager) Example As an example, the following steps show a complete flow for user \"Root\" to create a new DAO with the basic permissions set so that a Voting app can manage the funds stored in a Vault app : Deploy the Kernel Executing kernel.initialize(rootAddress) creates the \"permissions creator\" permission under the hood: createPermission(rootAddress, kernelAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, rootAddress) Deploy the Voting app Grant the Voting app the ability to call createPermission() : grantPermission(votingAppAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, kernelAddress) (must be executed by rootAddress ) Deploy the Vault app, which has a action called transferTokens() Create a new vote via the Voting app to create the TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE permission createPermission(votingAppAddress, vaultAppAddress, TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE, votingAppAddress) If the vote passes, the Voting app then has access to all actions in the Vault protected by TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE , which in this case is just transferTokens() Fund transfers from the Vault can now be controlled via votes from the Voting app. Each time a user wishes to transfer funds, they can create a new vote via the Voting app to propose an execution of the Vault's transferTokens() action. If, and only if, the vote passes, will the transferTokens() action be executed. Note that the Voting app is also able to revoke or regrant the TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE permission as it is that permission's manager on vaultAppAddress . Adding Permissions Apps have the choice of which actions to protect behind the ACL, as some actions may make sense to be completely public. Protecting an action behind the ACL is done in the smart contract by simply adding the authentication modifier auth() (passing the role required as a parameter) to the action. On executing the action, the auth() modifier checks with the Kernel whether the entity performing the call holds the required role or not. Escalating Permissions Consider kernel K , an entity E 0 , and an app A . E 0 wants to perform action A act on app A . The client knows, from information provided as part of the app's metadata , that in order to perform A act , an entity is required to have A role . Since E 0 doesn't hold A role , the client should know that E 0 cannot directly call A act , but that a list of entities [ E 1 , E 2 , ...] do have that role on app A . The client should then show the user the multiple possible forwarding paths to pass the call to E 1 , E 2 , etc, such that E 0 is able to perform A act through another, higher-privileged, entity. Calculating a forwarding path requires knowing what forwarders entity E 0 can escalate actions through. The user or contract performing this action could then choose their preferred route to forward permissions in order to perform A act . For example, E 1 may be a Voting app V , so the action would be to create a new vote that, in case of being approved, would call A act . Since V has role A role , it has permission to execute A act , and therefore we would have successfully completed a permission escalation. Permission escalations can be multiple levels deep. For example, imagine a user wants to invoke an action that requires a vote. If the only entity with permission to create a vote is the Token Manager app , then the user will have to forward their action first through the Token Manager and then through the Voting app. The Token Manager only allows a sender to forward actions if the sender owns tokens, so in this case, the user will also need to hold tokens before being able to start a vote. Note that a permission escalation can occur instantly or be delayed and require further action from other entities, like in the case of the Voting app. Forwarders In order to make permission escalation easier, we define a common interface for Forwarder s: contract Forwarder { bool isForwarder = true; function canForward(address sender, bytes evmCallScript) view returns (bool); function forward(bytes evmCallScript); } If a user wants to enact an action it cannot perform directly, it can check if there are forwarders. This checks for privileged entities that are accessible to any of the user's addresses for forwarding the action to. EVM Call Script The evmCallScript parameter in the Forwarder's interface allows for executing multiple calls with just one transaction. This is useful, for example, in the case of votings, as it allows approving multiple actions with just one vote. An evmCallScript is the concatenation of multiple evmCallAction s. A evmCallAction payload is: [ to (address: 20 bytes) ] [ calldataLength (uint32: 4 bytes) ] [ calldata (calldataLength bytes) ] When executed, actions in the evmCallScript are executed one at a time using the CALL opcode. If any one of the actions fails (i.e. CALL returns 0), the entire execution is reverted. A reference implementation for EVM Call Script can be found here: EVMCallScript.sol . 2. Upgradeability Upgradeability of the system is achieved by using the DelegateProxy pattern. Kernel and apps ( KernelProxy and AppProxy ) both use DelegateProxy with some added functionality. Given that new versions of apps or the kernel run in the exact same context as previous versions, the old storage layout must be taken into account. Inheriting from the old contract's storage before adding new storage variables is considered a safe practice. It is recommended to make sure the upgrade doesn't break the storage before pushing a new version. We will work on tooling to prevent issues with storage when upgrading. 2.1. Kernel upgradeability For the Kernel to be easily upgradeable, cheaply deployable, and more efficient, we use a proxy-type construct. Deploying a new DAO is done by deploying a KernelProxy contract that just delegates all calls to a kernel implementation at a given address, while still maintaining its own storage. Upgrading the kernel implementation in the proxy is as easy as changing its reference to another implementation's address. Note that, although this action is fairly easy to complete, it is extremely critical to the DAO and should be protected accordingly. 2.2. App-space upgradeability As apps can be used as entities (e.g. a voting app), it is important that each app is able to keep its address fixed to maintain its identity even if an upgrade changes the underlying logic. Keeping a fixed address also simplifies the upgrade process\u2014otherwise, each upgrade would also require any associated permissions in the ACL to be updated to the app's new address. One way of achieving this is through the concept of an AppProxy contract (inspired by augur-core\u2019s Delegators ). Deploying an app via an AppProxy contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version. The AppProxy contract then forwards the call by delegatecall ing into this address. It should be noted that multiple AppProxy contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple Fundraising AppProxy instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, e.g. the Aragon Network, in case organizations don\u2019t want to handle manual upgrades of their own apps. Set App Code kernel.setAppCode(bytes32 appId, address appCode) This action updates the implementation code registered for a given appId , such that all future calls to the app will use the new app code. If multiple app instances are installed for the given appId , they are all updated at the same time with this action. Note that all calls to an app will fail if an appId has not been set for its appCode . 3. Initialization The contracts that get deployed for each Kernel and app don't contain any business logic due to them relying on a proxy-like architecture for upgradeability. The proxy contracts are merely a way to point to the logic when called. However, this architecture impedes the ability to call the Solidity constructor. Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code. We instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the AppProxy contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction, AppProxy allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps. It is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization occurred. Clients can then use this to know from which block they should filter for events. 4. App discoverability and package versioning Technically, an app A is nothing more than a simple AppProxy contract holding a reference to a kernel K and an appId . If A doesn\u2019t have any permissions, both incoming and outgoing, set in K , A is effectively irrelevant to the DAO as nothing can call it and it cannot call anything. So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (i.e. defining what entities can do with the app and what the app can do in other apps). All relevant apps in a DAO should be discoverable by traversing its ACL, checking if any addresses are AppProxy s, and checking if those AppProxy s have a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that is the case, then the apps matching those AppProxy s' appId s are considered installed in the DAO. Application identifiers ( appId s) should be the namehash ed ENS name for the app's deployed contract: appId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d) An app's appId can be used as the identifier for its full package (including the app's frontend and other artifacts). Aragon owns and provides aragonpm.eth as a domain for developers to register their packages under. However, the system is designed to be domain agnostic: for example, district0x could decide to have all their packages under packages.district.eth . App Repos After discovering an entity in the DAO that is an app, we can fetch its appId and use ENS to resolve its Repo contract: repo = Resolver(ens.resolver(appId)).addr(appId) Repo contracts conform to the original Aragon Versioning Protocol but add more on-chain checks for version upgrades. Each Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner. A Repo keeps versioned state over: Smart contract app code ( contractAddress ): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The Kernel determines which version of the app it uses by pointing to the app code address associated with that version. Package content ( contentURI ): defined by a location ID of where the other components of the package (e.g. frontend) are hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and the content hash for fetching it. By versioning both the app code address and the package content, we can build in additional expectations for the semantic versioning of apps: Patch : Minor changes to the package contents (e.g. frontend). Update can be performed silently for users. Minor : Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current smart contract code. Users should be notified of the update. Major : Any change to the smart contract app code with or without an accompanying frontend upgrade. User interaction is needed to upgrade. A correct version upgrade for a package is defined by the following rules: Only one member of the version is increased by 1. The version components to the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components to the right must be 0. Example: From 2.1.3 the only allowed raises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), and 2.1.4 (patch version). Changes to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (upgrading it to x.0.0 by the above rule). By having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting its appId and appCode . Additional Packaging Requirements The package that is stored off-chain must contain a standard manifest.json .

It implements a UNIX-inspired permissioning system with smart contracts to allow for safe and efficient control over software resources. Smart contracts, an essential component of the Ethereum ecosystem, can define the rules and penalties around an agreement. They can also make decisions and enforce prior commitments, such as transfering large amounts of funds. However, such significant responsibilities make smart contracts a prime target for attacks. Testing and auditing them are not absolute remedies because, inevitably, humans make mistakes. So, how does one guarantee DAOs that run efficiently and securely? And how do we provide upgrading capabilities to these DAOs, to ensure the safety and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem? We present our secure decentralized operating system: aragonOS . This document provides a technical overview about the architecture.

The ACL permissioning system is inspired by UNIX. ACLs control the permissions afforded to a user in the system and can ease the transfer of said permissions. Similar to the sudo command in UNIX, users can escalate permissions, but with more flexibility and granularity. A reference implementation of the Kernel and its ACL can be found here: Kernel.sol .","title":"1.

Apps can interact with users and other smart contracts by implementing Action s, where each action is a publicly-accessible function that may or may not be protected by the ACL. Any actions that are protected are only allowed to be executed if the caller is permitted by the ACL. Because apps are upgradeable, we expect them to exist for a long period of time and be safely responsible for owning assets on behalf of the DAO (e.g. tokens and ENS names). App instances are identified by their deployed Ethereum addresses. More than one instance of a particular app can be installed in a DAO at a time (e.g. multiple Token Manager instances can be installed to control multiple tokens).","title":"Apps and Actions"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#roles","text":"Another feature in ensuring security within the ecosystem is the ease of delegating responsibilities for autonomous execution. Apps can define any number of Role s, where each role grants access to one or more of the app's actions as part of the app's ACL. Any entity wishing to perform an action protected by the ACL must have the necessary permissions by having a role that is capable of executing that action. Roles are always unique to each app. Having a given role in one app does not grant the permission to perform that same role in other apps. An entity can have many roles in one app. Example: contract TokenApp is App { bytes32 constant public MINT_ROLE = 0x1234; function mint(address _receiver, uint256 _amount) auth(MINT_ROLE) { \u2026 } } TokenApp is an app that defines one action, mint() , whose execution is controlled by MINT_ROLE .","title":"Roles"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#entity","text":"An Entity is any actor that is represented by an Ethereum address, such as a multisig (an account that needs multiple signatures before executing an action), an app (for example, a voting app that only executes an action if token holders vote favorably), or a simple private key controlled account.

E 0 wants to perform action A act on app A . The client knows, from information provided as part of the app's metadata , that in order to perform A act , an entity is required to have A role . Since E 0 doesn't hold A role , the client should know that E 0 cannot directly call A act , but that a list of entities [ E 1 , E 2 , ...] do have that role on app A . The client should then show the user the multiple possible forwarding paths to pass the call to E 1 , E 2 , etc, such that E 0 is able to perform A act through another, higher-privileged, entity. Calculating a forwarding path requires knowing what forwarders entity E 0 can escalate actions through. The user or contract performing this action could then choose their preferred route to forward permissions in order to perform A act . For example, E 1 may be a Voting app V , so the action would be to create a new vote that, in case of being approved, would call A act . Since V has role A role , it has permission to execute A act , and therefore we would have successfully completed a permission escalation. Permission escalations can be multiple levels deep. For example, imagine a user wants to invoke an action that requires a vote. If the only entity with permission to create a vote is the Token Manager app , then the user will have to forward their action first through the Token Manager and then through the Voting app. The Token Manager only allows a sender to forward actions if the sender owns tokens, so in this case, the user will also need to hold tokens before being able to start a vote.

Inheriting from the old contract's storage before adding new storage variables is considered a safe practice. It is recommended to make sure the upgrade doesn't break the storage before pushing a new version. We will work on tooling to prevent issues with storage when upgrading.","title":"2. Upgradeability"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#21-kernel-upgradeability","text":"For the Kernel to be easily upgradeable, cheaply deployable, and more efficient, we use a proxy-type construct. Deploying a new DAO is done by deploying a KernelProxy contract that just delegates all calls to a kernel implementation at a given address, while still maintaining its own storage. Upgrading the kernel implementation in the proxy is as easy as changing its reference to another implementation's address. Note that, although this action is fairly easy to complete, it is extremely critical to the DAO and should be protected accordingly.","title":"2.1.

Keeping a fixed address also simplifies the upgrade process\u2014otherwise, each upgrade would also require any associated permissions in the ACL to be updated to the app's new address. One way of achieving this is through the concept of an AppProxy contract (inspired by augur-core\u2019s Delegators ). Deploying an app via an AppProxy contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version. The AppProxy contract then forwards the call by delegatecall ing into this address. It should be noted that multiple AppProxy contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple Fundraising AppProxy instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, e.g. the Aragon Network, in case organizations don\u2019t want to handle manual upgrades of their own apps.","title":"2.2.

The proxy contracts are merely a way to point to the logic when called. However, this architecture impedes the ability to call the Solidity constructor. Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code. We instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the AppProxy contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction, AppProxy allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps. It is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization occurred. Clients can then use this to know from which block they should filter for events.","title":"3. Initialization"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#4-app-discoverability-and-package-versioning","text":"Technically, an app A is nothing more than a simple AppProxy contract holding a reference to a kernel K and an appId . If A doesn\u2019t have any permissions, both incoming and outgoing, set in K , A is effectively irrelevant to the DAO as nothing can call it and it cannot call anything. So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (i.e. defining what entities can do with the app and what the app can do in other apps). All relevant apps in a DAO should be discoverable by traversing its ACL, checking if any addresses are AppProxy s, and checking if those AppProxy s have a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that is the case, then the apps matching those AppProxy s' appId s are considered installed in the DAO. Application identifiers ( appId s) should be the namehash ed ENS name for the app's deployed contract: appId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d) An app's appId can be used as the identifier for its full package (including the app's frontend and other artifacts).

Each Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner. A Repo keeps versioned state over: Smart contract app code ( contractAddress ): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The Kernel determines which version of the app it uses by pointing to the app code address associated with that version. Package content ( contentURI ): defined by a location ID of where the other components of the package (e.g. frontend) are hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and the content hash for fetching it. By versioning both the app code address and the package content, we can build in additional expectations for the semantic versioning of apps: Patch : Minor changes to the package contents (e.g. frontend). Update can be performed silently for users. Minor : Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current smart contract code. Users should be notified of the update. Major : Any change to the smart contract app code with or without an accompanying frontend upgrade. User interaction is needed to upgrade. A correct version upgrade for a package is defined by the following rules: Only one member of the version is increased by 1. The version components to the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components to the right must be 0. Example: From 2.1.3 the only allowed raises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), and 2.1.4 (patch version). Changes to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (upgrading it to x.0.0 by the above rule). By having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting its appId and appCode .","title":"App Repos"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#additional-packaging-requirements","text":"The package that is stored off-chain must contain a standard manifest.json .

The decision to redesign the DApp was simple. There was a need to align the app and it\u2019s updated graphical identity, design principles and use cases to the origin of the project. Exciting! Team Interviews: Alexa, Aragon\u2019s Operations Assistant Alexa took the leap into the blockchain world and isn\u2019t looking back Today our Team Interview is with Alexa, Aragon\u2019s new Operations Assistant\u2014 we discussed what brought her to work in the blockchain space and why did she choose to work on Aragon. Thoughts On Governance and Network Effects This post discusses governance and its impact on network effects and why both relate to how value flows and is captured within tokenized blockchain networks. Team Interviews: Brett, Aragon\u2019s EVM Engineer Brett is the most recent wizard to join the team This Team Interview focuses on Brett, Aragon\u2019s new EVM/Solidity Engineer\u2014 how he came to work at Aragon, what he thinks of Ethereum and the decentralization movement as well as what this coding wizard uses in his work set up. Introducing Aragon Nest A grants program to support the development of the ecosystems To help support the ecosystem flourish, we are introducing, together with Placeholder \u200a\u2014\u200alead by Joel Monegro and Chris Burniske \u200a\u2014\u200aa grants program called Aragon Nest . Team Interviews: John, Aragon\u2019s Community Lead John joins the team as the new Community Lead John Light has been involved in the cryptocurrency scene for years and we really want to give him a warm welcome from everyone in the team! In this interview he will share his reflections on Ethereum and on how he came to work at Aragon with some fresh ideas which he intends to bring to life soon. November Aragon Team Update: November 2017 Written reviews of what the team members have been up to Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting. Aragon Q3 Transparency Report A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q3 2017 As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. Team Interviews: Pierre, Aragon\u2019s Frontend Developer I interviewed Pierre about how he came to work at Aragon, his thoughts on the future of Ethereum and tips for aspiring developers and teams Another new member has joined the team! Pierre is a Frontend Developer that will help the team in fulfilling the Aragon vision. We talked about his experience as a software developer making beautiful user experiences, his thoughts on Ethereum, what tools he uses and what tips he has for aspiring developers and teams working in the space. October Team Interviews: Luke, Aragon\u2019s Research Lead Luke and I talked about how he got involved with Ethereum and Aragon as well as what he sees that the future holds for them Our team has grown and gained a new member again! Today we\u2019re introducing Luke as a new addition. We discussed how he got into working on Ethereum and Aragon, what his vision of their future is and what he\u2019s most excited about getting to work on. Aragon Q3 Development Update This quarter we have been hard at work developing the new v0.5 release . This release paves the way for Aragon to be an extendable governance tool which supports all possible use cases. It has required an immense amount of changes, including a re-architecturing called aragonOS Aragon Chat is now open Aragon starts using the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat We\u2019re happy to inform you that the migration to Rocket Chat is now complete. All users and public channels have been migrated over to the new platform, so feel free to jump in and join the conversation! To use the new Aragon Chat, you can connect directly via the web page or download one of the clients available for Rocket Chat and point it to https://aragon.chat Introducing aragonOS: Say hi to modular and extendable organizations Aragon\u2019s new exokernel-inspired architecture aragonOS smart contract architecture is based on the idea of an organization being the aggregate of multiple components (called applications ) and a pillar that is the Kernel , which governs how these applications can talk to each other and how other entities can interact with them. September Aragon will be Community Governed What community governance really entails Since the inception of the project, Aragon\u2019s vision has been to be open source software and to give power over it to the people who use it. The whole platform will be a community effort\u200a\u2014\u200aand it will take time to build it as envisioned. Right now we are a community based project and our long-term plan is to be a community governed project. To learn why this has been our vision for the project, where we are at the moment and how we plan on achieving our goals, let\u2019s take a look into the history and definition of these terms Announcing Our Migration To An Open Source Messaging Platform Aragon will migrate to Rocket Chat along with 10 other Ethereum projects Today we are announcing the plan of several Ethereum based projects to migrate to the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat. Aragon will be migrating our community out of Slack and onto Rocket Chat in the next couple of weeks. This has been a joint effort from the projects participating in the migration plan. Aragon initially started the proposal for the community after there had already been discussion on the subject from multiple projects. We came together as members of the same ecosystem and community to work on this plan to find an alternative that fit the needs of these cryptocurrency projects. August Why Transparency Matters Aragon Transparency Model and the unveiling of Aragon\u2019s new Transparency Framework At Aragon, we feel obliged to show to our community\u200a\u2014\u200asupporters, contributors and token holders\u200a\u2014\u200athat we are being productive, effective and using the raised funds in a responsible manner. The community is very important to us, they are the ones that we\u2019re building this project for. They support us, provide feedback and ideas on how we can all move forward while catering the needs of the users. In turn, we want to uphold our high transparency standards to keep the community up to date on what we are doing. This is why we\u2019re showcasing our model for doing things transparently. This all began with our Pre-Sale Transparency Report. And recently continued with the Token Buyback Transparency Report. We\u2019ll now present you with all the different methods we\u2019re employing. The parts of our project\u2019s transparency model, starting with the new Transparency Framework. Token Buyback Transparency Report Why did we buy back ANT and how we will disclose these events Today, adhering to our high transparency standards, we\u2019re ready to take the first step in our plan to extend our level of transparency\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is why we\u2019re reporting our token buybacks. In our Intended Use of Revenue post we outlined the broad estimated allocation of our funds. As the development of our project has continued, we\u2019ve been able to narrow down some of the use cases of which we\u2019ll use our funds for. July Aragon Network Jurisdiction Part 1: Decentralized Court When first designing Aragon, the goal was to have organizations run entirely trustless. Thus, we created a platform to create organizations governed by trustless and immutable code. Now, when we say that these organizations run in a trustless manner, we\u2019re talking about how to describe the laws under which the code runs. Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it. Yet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world. And often, in the case of disputes, things are subjective and up to interpretation. Our solution to this problem is the Aragon Network Jurisdiction. A decentralized jurisdiction to solve subjective disputes as an Aragon Network service. The emergent Ethereum stack district0x, the first manifestation of the Ethereum + Aragon stack Software allows us to abstract away from existing functionality to focus on building. At Aragon, we use Ethereum. Ethereum provides us the consensus layer to establish truth. And the ability to create smart contracts that are self-enforcing. So, generally speaking, we don\u2019t have to worry about Ethereum. We use Ethereum, driving usage to the platform, thus increasing its value. So we\u2019re indirectly funding its further development. That\u2019s the virtuous circle that tokenization makes possible. Aragon\u2019s Community Governance Model How we plan to achieve transparency and inclusion for the community Our community is everything for us. With Aragon, we want a thousand communities to flourish. Tokens align the incentives of communities and projects towards the same goals and values. But those communities are the center of where the magic happens. Two weeks ago we posted our Community Governance Model for feedback from the community. We received some comments on it, and we now have the final version of the model ready. Before this, we had already worked on the model internally. I drafted the original version and Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo provided their thoughts on it. Further changes might be made as things develop. But we wanted to show the community what we\u2019ll be doing in terms of governance, transparency and inclusion. The model was designed so that every community member will be treated equally. Everyone will have the same changes of participation, and our Meetings and decisions to be transparent. Introducing Mihai Alisie as an Advisor Why him, why now and the road ahead We announced two of our Advisors before the successful ANT sale. Kenny Rowe from the MakerDAO project and Jake Brukhman of CoinFund. Both experts in their fields and respected members of the Ethereum community. While we did have our Board of Advisors in place before the token sale, we chose not to disclose all the members then. Aragon Q2 Development Update v0.4 release status and the road ahead We will be delivering regular updates on the development of Aragon. This is our first quarterly update to bring the community up to speed on where we\u2019re at and the road ahead. June Team Interviews: Mar\u00eda, Aragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations Mar\u00eda shares her thoughts about Aragon and what got her into working on an Ethereum based project As a continuation on our team interview series, I interviewed Mar\u00eda\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about her, her interest in Ethereum, how she came to work, and her role, at Aragon. Aragon to power the district0x Network Welcoming district0x to the Aragon Network Jurisdiction Today, we are pleased to introduce the first resident of the Aragon Network Jurisdiction, the district0x Network The district0x Network is a collective of decentralized marketplaces and communities powered by Ethereum, Aragon, and IPFS. Markets on the network, also referred to as districts, are all built upon a shared framework comprised of smart contracts and front-end libraries which provide the functionality necessary to operate communal marketplaces which are similar to services like AirBNB, eBay, Uber, or Reddit with payments. Aragon partners with 0x Making decentralized organizations go beyond Ether So today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019re partnering with 0x to allow Aragon organizations to accept and operate with any token. 0x is a protocol for decentralized exchange on Ethereum allowing users to exchange tokens without a central broker\u200a\u2014\u200aending the many inefficiencies of centralization by enabling transparent token exchanges between contracts. Team Interviews: Tatu, Aragon\u2019s Community Lead Tatu talks about why he is part of the Ethereum community and why he is so enthusiastic about Aragon and decentralization As part of our team interview series (Luis\u2019 Interview|Jorge\u2019s Interview), I\u2019ve interviewed Tatu\u2014 Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about his experience in the Ethereum ecosystem, the projects he\u2019s most excited about, and why he chose to work for Aragon. May Announcing the ENS Aragon Network Company Registry With Aragon, we set out to create software that makes it easy to create and run decentralized organizations. However, meaningless ETH addresses made sending funds and completing transactions for operating a business unnecessarily complicated. Fortunately, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) recently solved this issue by enabling the assignment of human-readable names to eth addresses. This was important for the entire Ethereum ecosystem (including Aragon)\u2014 no longer do you have to send transactions to a series of numbers and letters. So today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we won the bid for the name company.eth! In this post, we\u2019ll explain how Aragon organizations will use the name and the implications for Aragon Network user-adoption. The Aragon Token Sale: The Numbers Roughly $25 million was collected in 26 minutes. The rate was $122k/s the first 3 blocks. Yesterday, we closed the 4th largest crowdfunding event in history, and the 2nd largest in the blockchain space (after The DAO). Raising 275,000 ether, or roughly $25 million, we\u2019re incredibly humbled by the support of the community and the trust in our mission to make decentralized autonomous organizations widespread. In this post, we\u2019d like to reflect on the last 48 hours, provide some data on the sale, and most importantly express our gratitude to the community. Final token sale recap Please read How to Securely Participate in the sale for information and tutorials on how to participate. Pre-Sale Transparency Report Before tomorrow\u2019s token sale, we believe it\u2019s important that we release a transparency report about the pre-sale. This post will provide you with details on who purchased ANT before the token sale, the terms of the sale, the total Ether received, and how those funds were used. Aragon Token Sale Contracts Have Been Deployed and Activated ANT sale begins on Ethereum mainnet\u2019s block 3,723,000\u200a\u2014\u200aMay 17, ~6pm GMT How to Participate in the Sale Wait for block 3,723,000 (May 17 at approximately 6pm GMT). You can check what the latest block is on Etherscan. After block 3,722,999 has been mined, it is safe to send the transaction. Note that sending the transaction before that block is mined will result in a loss of fees. Send ETH to the address posted on https://aragon.network Send at least 200,000 gas with your transaction. If your contribution is accepted, tokens will be transferred to your address in the same transaction. However, tokens will not be transferable until the sale is finalized. Introducing the Aragon Community Multisig A 3/5 multisig that will approve the deployment of the Aragon Network The Aragon Network Token (ANT) will initially begin as an upgradable token, but will evolve to serve as the governance token for the Aragon Network when deployed. We estimate that the Aragon Network will be deployed in May of 2018. Prior to deployment and transition to a governance token, we plan to perform numerous audits and bug bounties to ensure thorough testing and to mitigate the risk of another DAO hack. However, the actual ANT token will be first distributed in 2 days. So this raises the question: how do we plan to upgrade the token\u2019s functionality to a governance token? Token sale cap clarification tl;dr: Our cap is not $100m, or near that amount We have had a lot of questions about our hidden cap mechanism. Since it\u2019s pretty new to the token sale world, we understand the confusion and want to provide a simple breakdown to clarify. Token Sale Audit Results No Critical Issues Reported and Token Sale is On-Schedule To ensure a stable and safe token sale, we employed the help of Jordi Baylina and Piper Merriam to perform independent audits of Aragon token sale contract code. Jordi and Piper completed their reports this week and published their independent findings (Jordi\u2019s Report | Piper\u2019s Report). No critical issues were reported in either independent audit. And for the issues that were found, we\u2019ve worked closely with Jordi and Piper to resolve them and improve the code. In addition, we\u2019re happy to announce that there have been no critical issues reported through the bug bounty program. Thanks to all of those that have participated, and note that the bug bounty program will continue indefinitely. Announcing the Aragon Advisors Kenny from MakerDAO and Jake from CoinFund will be advising Aragon We are pleased to announce two people that we really admire in the Ethereum community will be joining us as advis0rs: Kenny Rowe and Jake Brukhman. Open Sourcing Aragon Making Aragon Code Accessible and Providing Documentation Soon When I was 12, I got my first laptop\u200a\u2014\u200aa piece of junk with only 256MB of RAM. It was slow and literally falling apart. But this didn\u2019t stop me from developing. Using Linux, I had the latest available software. And thanks to thousands of developers around the world, I could examine different pieces of code and learn programming. The free software and open source phenomena has not only made the world a more inclusive place, but it has also increased the speed of software development\u200a\u2014\u200aby sharing, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel. For example, we didn\u2019t have to build the native app wrapper or the Ethereum wallet for Aragon. So when we find something that we can give back to the community, we make a point of doing so. We\u2019ve found that by sharing code, others can learn from it (like I did as a teenager) and people will find ways to improve it. How to Securely Participate in the Aragon Token Sale Using Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask The ANT token sale is happening on May 17th! In anticipation, we\u2019ve been and will continue to frequently post about Aragon and sale details. In this post, we list the sources to trust for ANT sale information, and provide instructions for purchasing with Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask. Aragon On Tour: Meetups Around the Globe Come to one of our meetups, have a beer with us and talk decentralized awesomeness On the Internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog. This has been extremely beneficial for the development of communities around the world, and crypto is perhaps one of the most remarkable examples. But who doesn\u2019t like to have a beer with people that share common interests? It\u2019s part of our human nature! So aside from being on Slack all day and night, we\u2019ve organized a series of meetups for Ethereum Aragon enthusiasts to get together to talk about exciting projects and have a few drinks! Aragon Tutorial: Raising funds with a token How you can raise capital creating your own token in a few clicks Token sales are changing the rules of the game, making it extremely easy for anyone in the world to gather capital and build new products. With Aragon, you can create token sales in a few clicks and publish the sale address so everyone can participate. Our Public Product Roadmap and Issue Reporting Enhancing transparency in product development Often, product and software development is secretive and confidential until the official product launch. While this has the effect of building excitement, it can lead to unrealistic user expectations, development of products that are missing key features, and ultimately products that miss end-user needs. As a result, we believe it\u2019s important to engage the community throughout the product development process\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is what we\u2019ve done while developing Aragon. The community has consistently provided valuable feedback and unique perspectives. From user interface design to our token model, feedback from the Aragon community has guided Aragon Core and Network development. Aragon token sale bug bounty We\u2019re excited to announce that we are conducting a bug bounty in advance of the Aragon Network Token sale. We believe bug bounties are essential to ensuring a safe release, and are especially important when cryptocurrency is being exchanged. This post will provide more details on our bug bounty program scope, the timeline, and compensation. Aragon Tutorial: Tokens and voting How you can easily create your own token and govern your organization with it From the beginning, we wanted Aragon to be a tool that anyone can use. So we put a lot of thought into making things easy. To make things even easier, we are starting a series of short videos that explain every part of Aragon. Our Intended Use of Revenue How we plan to use the token sale to drive development As previously announced, the Aragon Network Token (ANT) sale will be conducted on May 17th. The funds raised will fund Aragon Core development and the Network deployment. The specific steps and timeline to make Aragon production ready are outlined in our development plan, released last week. In this post, we\u2019re excited to provide details on our intended use of revenue from the token sale. April Aragon + Status: Bringing decentralized organizations everywhere Getting ready to offer Aragon to 2.3bn smartphone users Our mission at Aragon is to make decentralized organizations widespread. To achieve our mission, we built a dApp to easily create and operate decentralized organizations on Ethereum. First, we focused on building a feature rich web and desktop (including MacOS, Linux, and Windows) application. But our initial focus ignored a major way that over 2.3 billion people interact with applications today: their smartphones. The reason we ignored these users was simple\u200a\u2014\u200athe development effort to create mobile applications is significant and would distract from developing fully featured web and desktop versions. A note for exchanges or holders interacting with ANT in an automated manner The Aragon Network Token has vesting built in that limits the transferability of the token until a specified time. Aragon Token Sale Technical Overview TL;DR: ANT is a MiniMe Token with built-in vesting functionality. Two security audits are currently being performed and a bug bounty will begin soon. ANT contract code is live on Github. This post will discuss the ANT base token and its functionality, the ANT sale contract, and the current state of ANT security and future efforts to ensure a successful token sale. The path to mainstream decentralized organizations Yesterday, we published our development plan for Aragon Core and the Aragon Network. This post explains in greater detail our structure to store and allocate funds from Aragon Network Token (ANT) sales, features of the next Aragon Core release, and plans to deploy the Aragon Network and its first organizations. Introducing the Aragon Development Plan The road ahead to make decentralized organizations widespread Last week, we announced our token sale and its terms. Today, we will be addressing the future of Aragon, by releasing our Development Plan. Aragon Network Token sale terms Founder vesting, simple pricing and distribution Yesterday we announced the Aragon Network Token sale. Today, we will go into its details. For a simple overview of the sale in just one page, download the one pager. Announcing the Aragon Network Token sale ANT sale starts on May 17th. Bootstrapping the creation of the world\u2019s first digital jurisdiction. We have been asked countless times about whether we would do a token sale or not. Our answer always was: if it makes sense, we will! After launching Aragon, we spent a lot of time talking to people and thinking. What will be the main issues to make decentralized organizations widespread? Team Interviews: Luis, Aragon\u2019s Project Lead Luis talks about why he is creating Aragon and his long-term vision for it I have interviewed my cofounder Luis\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Project Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the future of the project, and his long term vision. Introducing the Aragon Network Solving the biggest hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread Our first step was to develop an extremely easy to use product on top of the Ethereum blockchain that lets everyone run decentralized organizations. Now we have validated the concept, the market interest and most importantly, the main hurdles to realize our vision. Those main hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread are upgradeability and decentralized arbitration. The 8 pillars of any organization A walk-through of Aragon and the why behind each feature When we set out to create Aragon, we researched what were the core features that an organization needs. Last year, the 11th of November, we came up with the first version of the product full spec. Most of the features that you see today in Aragon, as well as how they are structured, were laid out that month. Since we have been asked a few times which was our thought process to came up with that features, I\u2019ll go through it. Team Interviews: Jorge, Aragon\u2019s Tech Lead Jorge talks about what excites him the most about Aragon, and the road ahead I have interviewed my cofounder Jorge\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Tech Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the Ethereum community, his workspace and the road ahead. Decentralized organizations can solve the world\u2019s worst problems Disintermediating human trade\u200a\u2014\u200abusiness\u200a\u2014\u200ais the first step towards a more fair world We take most power for granted. After all, humans enforce most of their social contracts by giving away some freedom. We usually think about intermediaries in a microscopic scale. We think about the guy who delivered us a package. Or the agency we hired to find us a buyer for an apartment. Yet those intermediaries are insignificant compared to the macro-scale intermediaries. March The Governance Release, Alpha 0.3 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f Bring your token, new bylaws, web version and more Tokens are changing the rules of the game. We don\u2019t need to think about obscure business models anymore. We can align our users\u2019 incentives with ours and release a token that implements that logic. At Aragon we believe that we are at the dawn of this token model. And we want to help the community in this journey. So today, we are introducing ERC20 token support for Aragon. Releasing Aragon Alpha \ud83d\ude80 One month ago, we introduced our vision of how companies and organizations will work. And we set to make it a reality. Today, I want to personally thank all the community for the warmest welcome we could have ever dreamed of for Aragon. Advanced Solidity code deployment techniques This is a continuation post to the work we did with Zeppelin for the article on Proxy libraries for code upgradeability. Reading that post is not required in order to understand this one, but it is definitely a recommended read, as the ideas are pretty much on the same line. And towards the end we will combine them. Electron + MetaMask = Secure, Easy to Use Dapps \ud83d\udd12 Sandboxing Ethereum DApps with Electron When we chose what would be our main build target for Aragon, our priorities for choosing Electron + MetaMask were security and usability. Of course Aragon also runs on any Web3 environment (like Mist, Parity, Chrome with MetaMask\u2026) but we wanted to have a build target in which we have full control over the user experience. Since we got part of the community intrigued on how our implementation works, this post hopes to explain our decisions and the challenges we found. How Aragon approaches identity and the Ethereum Keybase Resolver Identity is one of the most important parts when developing decentralized applications. This is specially true for Aragon, where identity is needed to know who are you doing business with or who are the people that will manage the money you are investing. February Library Driven Development in Solidity A comprehensive review on how to develop more modular, reusable and elegant smart contract systems on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine by using libraries Introducing Aragon: Unstoppable companies Today, taking a stand to help this fight, we are introducing Aragon. Aragon is everything you need to operate your company or organizational structure, on Ethereum. Aragon lets everyone create value without borders or intermediaries.

Now, when we say that these organizations run in a trustless manner, we\u2019re talking about how to describe the laws under which the code runs. Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it. Yet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world.

November Aragon Monthly Issue 10 is out! The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem Aragon Monthly was introduced a while back in my post Bringing DAOs back\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon Monthly and has since been a monthly aggregated source of News and Articles for people interested in decentralized organizations and governance. Welcoming Stefano to the Aragon Association A new cycle for the Aragon Association with Stefano Bernardi as its Executive Director. Today, we couldn't be happier to be welcoming Stefano Bernardi as the Executive Director of the Aragon Association. Releasing aragonOS 4\u2013A refinement to our smart contract framework Enhanced capabilities, reviewed by two independent audits, and depended upon by more than 100 DAOs on the Ethereum Mainnet. If aragonOS 3 was all about pushing the bleeding edge further in smart contract design, aragonOS 4 is the culmination of our efforts to produce a refined, sharpened edge trustworthy for use in the adversarial environment of a public Ethereum network. Final results from the AGP-1 vote We're excited and proud to say that ANT voters overwhelmingly voted to approve AGP-1. After one month of preparation, starting with a public review and comment period and ending with a final approval by the Aragon Association Board of Directors, Aragon Network Token holders were given an opportunity to approve or reject AGP-1, the Aragon Governance Proposal process, on November 15, 2018 in a vote that lasted for 48 hours. Aragon Nest Q3 Updates We are happy to introduce updates from these six amazing teams working on the Aragon and Ethereum ecosystems! As more teams get grants from the Nest program, also the amount of goals achieved increases. We are preparing for this by giving the teams their own voice here in the Aragon Project blog. Aragon Monthly Issue 09 is out! The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem Aragon Monthly was introduced a while back in my post Bringing DAOs back\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon Monthly and has since been a monthly aggregated source of News and Articles for people interested in decentralized organizations and governance. Aragon Q3 2018 Transparency Report A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q3 2018. As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. Aragon Q3 Development Update Progress of development from the third quarter of 2018. A number of major milestones were reached in the months of July to September, 2018. Culminating in our decision to buckle down and launch the first Mainnet release of Aragon at Devcon IV. Final details about the ANT vote on AGP-1 Decentralizing Aragon community governance On October 16th we announced the opening of the public review and comment period for the draft of AGP-1, the newly proposed Aragon Governance Proposal process. This review period ended last Friday, November 9th, and was followed by a final review and vote by the Aragon Association Board of Directors. I am pleased to announce that the Aragon Association board has voted unanimously to approve AGP-1 for an Aragon Network Token vote. Aragon @ DevCon4 Recap CENTRALIZATION IS STRENGTH Every DevCon is special. But this one was especially special to Aragon. We had most of the team in Prague for the occasion, several of whom also attended the wonderfully organized #CryptoLife hackathon and the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians Council of Prague in the days preceding the annual Ethereum family reunion. At this year\u2019s DevCon, we were out to share the good news: Aragon is bringing DAOs back, mainnet style. October Aragon 0.6 is live on Mainnet Decentralized organizations just got real. Using Aragon 0.6, named Alba, you can now create Aragon organizations on the Ethereum Mainnet. This is a new era for human collaboration. New kinds of organizations that we haven't even dreamed of before can be now created. Flock, funding for Aragon teams The next step in decentralizing Aragon's development. Earlier this year we set the path for decentralizing Aragon's development. And, after half a year, our vision is already a reality. There are two teams working on Aragon's development already: Aragon One and Aragon DAC. Aragon Nest: Third round of grants Five new teams have been awarded grants with funding from the Aragon Project. The Nest grants program has introduced rounds one and two with the first teams. We now have five more teams that have been granted funding by the Aragon Project. What does governance mean An intro to the principles of governance. Every collective action whether it is a small group or a vast nation-state follows a governance process. Sometimes this process is formalized, well-documented, and rigid. Other times it is so fluid and informal that it is difficult to observe. The purpose of this post is not to prescribe or analyze any specific process or method for governing, as governance is contextual. Instead, I want to describe a framework for thinking about the power dynamics associated with a governance process, and explore why its important to decentralize governance by establishing processes which prevent or mitigate the ability for power to concentrate and subvert the process at the expense of the organization as a whole. Deprecation notice for v0.5 Rinkeby DAOs Existing test organizations deployed on Rinkeby to be deprecated after Oct. 28th. Since the launch of Aragon Core v0.5 on the Rinkeby testnet this March, the Aragon One development team has been continually improving and battle testing the smart contracts that form the bedrock of over 2500 test organizations. However, as we progress toward a Mainnet launch, it's time to start bringing the latest technology to decentralized organizations. To do this, on October 29, 2018, we will upgrade Aragon Core to version 0.6 on Rinkeby. This new version will include contracts that are not backwards-compatible with the existing v0.5 organizations. As part of the upgrade, we will also be deploying a new ENS registry that will reset the organization names available on aragonid.eth. As a result, any existing test organizations deployed on Rinkeby will be deprecated on Oct. 29, 2018. Aragon Nest Update\u2014Evolution of the grants program The Nest program has been up and running for 7 months already. It's mature enough to make a high level analysis of the program so far and talk a bit about its future. Nest is the grants program run by the Aragon Association (formerly the Aragon Foundation). The process is public and transparent. The Aragon One team was the only team managing it and deciding who and what gets funded up until now. Currently, the Aragon DAC, the new Aragon team, is also participating in the application process. The idea is that all the different Aragon teams will have a part to play in this grants program. Nest Team Interviews: Prysmatic Labs The third of our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is with Prysmatic Labs who are building an Ethereum sharding client. With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. Announcing AraCon \u2014 The Aragon Conference Today we\u2019re announcing the first Aragon Conference \u2014 AraCon. AraCon is the culmination of all the people supporting this and we couldn\u2019t be happier to be inviting everyone to join us at this event. September Aragon Community Update #1 Welcome to the first Aragon community update! We\u2019ve had a lot going on in the foreground and background of the community since I first joined as Community Lead last year and I\u2019m excited to share some of what we\u2019ve been up to. Aragon Monthly Issue 08 is out! The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem Aragon Monthly was introduced a while back in my post Bringing DAOs back\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon Monthly and has since been a monthly aggregated source of News and Articles for people interested in decentralized organizations and governance. Nest Team Interviews: Pando The second of our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is with Pando who are also working on an open source incentivization app. With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. Pando, when complete, will be a big step towards decentralization of development for all. Building a decentralized OS How we built an Ethereum operating system that is upgradeable, secure and easy to use The general concept goes as follows: You wouldn't want a Tetris app to own full control over your RAM. That would enable tampering with other apps or stealing precious information. Similarly, you wouldn't want a CryptoKitties app to have full control over the funds of your DAO. The role of the OS is to impose a rule system to not let that happen. Nest Team Interviews: That Planning Suite The first one on our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is That Planning Suite who are working on an open source incentivization app. With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. That Planning Suite was the first team accepted into the program and we're all thrilled to see their suite of apps becoming a part of the Aragon ecosystem. Aragon at ETHBerlin Hey, hey, heeey! This is Aragon and we are coming to ETHBerlin, Berlin! We are so excited, so happy, really so thrilled to be Tier 5 \u2013 The Carlos Matos sponsor of the hackathon. Our mentors are coming, and they are coming in waves! Let me tell you, that we started 92 days ago with only one goal in mind. And right now, we are reaching that goal of being a part of the astonishing and inspiring ETHBerlin hackathon. And let me tell you that we are now actually putting two distinct bounty tracks up for hackers to #buidl on during the hackathon! August Aragon Labs Research Update #1 Latest news from the Aragon Research Development department, Labs Our research efforts are on exploring how to realize the lofty ambition of becoming a decentralized, digital jurisdiction. Both the scope and range of services a jurisdiction could offer to attract its constituency are vast and worth exploring. The single most crucial consideration right now is how it will be governed. With effective governance processes we can create new tools for the community. Tools to create new services, or replace or alter existing services, as required to make organizations more effective. Aragon Monthly Issue 07 is out! The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem. Created by the community, for the community. Aragon Q2 2018 Transparency Report A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q2 2018 As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. Aragon Nest: Updates from the teams #1 Because accountability is key on funding new teams to work on decentralized ecosystems One of the future plans for Nest is to start involving the community further so that it can participate in the decision making process regarding Nest's yearly budget and its governance... With those plans in mind we want to share with the community the progress of the first batch of the teams funded. The challenges they have faced, and the milestones they have accomplished. We plan to have the teams do these public updates every quarter. One of the key differentiators of the Nest program has always been transparency. Aragon Nest: Second round of grants Four new teams have been awarded grants with funding from the Aragon Project Earlier the Nest grants program introduced the five first teams that had been awarded grants and told what they are working on. On this second update we announce the four new teams that have been granted funding by the Aragon Project. Aragon Q2 Development Update Progress of development from the second quarter of 2018 and first round of audit results Our developers have hard at work and here's a recap of the progress of development from the second quarter of 2018. Earlier we told that first round of audits was underway and today we are also publishing the results of that audit! Aragon DAC, a new community effort to foster Aragon's development led by Giveth The Aragon Foundation and Giveth are proud to announce the launch of Aragon DAC, a Decentralized Altruistic Community on the Giveth platform that will work on building out core Aragon infrastructure from the end user's perspective You might know by now that Aragon is decentralizing its development: the first step was the introduction of Aragon One, the next step was announcing the onboarding of more teams to work on core infrastructure, in the near future. Well, the future is today! Aragon against censorship\u2014Goodbye Medium, hello Ghost Aragon is taking action against censorship by moving away from Medium On the journey that we are on, making Web3.0, the decentralized web, a reality, there will be obstacles we need to overcome. Hurdles set by those clinging on to their power by any means necessary, even going as far as putting on blanket bans on all crypto projects. This effectively is censoring content by those trying to make the world a more free and open place to live. July Deploying and distributing Aragon Core How to deploy and distribute a censorship-resistant upgradeable dApp From the inception of the first versions of Aragon Core we took building a truly decentralized app very seriously. We decided that just using Ethereum as the settlement layer was not enough, because if a significant part of the infrastructure depended on centralized servers, we would quickly become a central point of failure that could be taken down. Manifesto-based organizations How to fix soulless corporations from making everyone miserable In the ideal world, every organization has a manifesto with its mission and values. Those values could be ranked, just like in the Aragon Manifesto. If an organization fails to follow their manifesto, users can point out the value they broke. Aragon Monthly Issue 06 is out! The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem. Created by the community, for the community. On Signaling and Social Pressure How the Ethereum community could begin making meaningful signaling-based decisions With the recent Mainnet release of our Survey app , I would like to propose the idea of Signaling DAOs as a way for stakeholder groups to self organize and produce clear signals. A Signaling DAO could be created by anyone, but in order for it to be impactful it should attempt to be representative of a relevant stakeholder group. Community Aggregation Theory \ud83d\udc08 Exploring how the valuation models fail to account for protocol commoditization This post explores how the valuation models used to evaluate decentralized service protocols leveraging \u201cwork\u201d tokens fail to account for protocol commoditization. June Aragon Core v0.5.1 Post Mortem\u200a\u2014\u200aPart 1 Summary of our first new development cycle Our initial goal is to establish three two-week sprints. These sprints define a six week cycle. We established this goal as a starting point for the new product development process. The goal emerged from a discussion at our last offsite meeting in Switzerland. 0.5.1 started immediately after the offsite, on 16 April 2018. Opening applications for the Building DAOs video series Join us in building your own customized DAO on Ethereum With the recent launch of Aragon Core v0.5 we have seen a lot of renewed interest from people wanting to use Aragon to build their own decentralized organizations, or DAOs for short. To help kick off the process, we are excited to invite our community to participate in Building DAOs, an educational video series that will feature the Aragon One developer team working side-by-side with community members and their teams to configure their smart contracts and build their DAOs. May Aragon launches Survey app on Mainnet First Aragon app launched on Ethereum Mainnet for community sentiment signaling Today we are releasing an entirely new step for community members to signal their sentiment on the project and igniting the next level of participation in the project for all ANT holders. Survey app is the fourth app developed by our team in addition to the Token Manager, Voting Finance apps seen previously in Aragon Core v0.5. And the first one to launch on the Ethereum Mainnet. Aragon Network\u200a\u2014\u200aOn a path towards a digital jurisdiction Launch of a new edition of the Aragon Network whitepaper and our research forum As we have continued on our journey thinking about the challenges of creating a jurisdiction designed to be inclusive of DAOs and other pseudoanynomous entities, the economics and mechanisms in the original whitepaper have continued to evolve. Thus far, this progression has mostly been loose thoughts scattered among various chats and in-person conversations. But as development of the underlying infrastructure to support the network is maturing, the need for formalizing how the Aragon Network will operate grows. Aragon Q1 Transparency Report A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q1 2018 As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. Releasing the Aragon Developer Portal A new command line tool for building Aragon apps, a straightforward tutorial, and reference documentation for all the building blocks Today, we introduce tools and documentation for: aragonOS, the smart contract framework that provides upgradeability and governance solutions out-of-the-box aragonUI, for a beautiful frontend experience aragon.js, in the middle connecting the two together Decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development III: Onboarding new teams Incentivizing new teams to work on common Aragon infrastructure We have already explained why we are decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development, how we are decentralizing the legal vehicle that represents the project and introduced Aragon One, the first company contributing to Aragon\u2019s development. In this post, we will lay out the strategy for onboarding more teams to work on core Aragon infrastructure. Introducing Aragon One The first company contributing to Aragon\u2019s development Since we released the first version of the Aragon whitepaper, we knew that it was important to split the non-profit entity overseeing the project from the actual companies or teams working on its development. Today, we are announcing the next step. We are announcing Aragon One. First community-wide Aragon Feedback Survey! Tell us what you think of Aragon and how we can improve the project in the future Now that we have released Aragon Core v0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s time to hear your thoughts on how has your experience with it been and how can we improve it in the future. This survey is about the Aragon project in general, so you can take part even if you haven\u2019t used the app yet! Aragon Q1 Development Update Progress of development from the first quarter of 2018 Releasing Aragon Core v0.5, The Architect, was the biggest development milestone during the first quarter of the year. Aragon Nest: First awarded grants Five teams already funded and building is underway Now, it\u2019s time to introduce the first five projects that we\u2019ve granted funding in order for them to flourish, thrive and to pursue their goals of advancing these ecosystems. The Aragon Manifesto A pledge to fight for freedom We believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another. Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies. Decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development II: Minimum Viable Foundation Reducing the Aragon Foundation to its minimum in order to decentralize the governance and development of the project We have previously shared our plans to transform the Aragon project to a community governed project. As described in the decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development post, reducing the Foundation to its minimum is a key step in reaching that goal and decoupling the project from the foundational team working on it, and to level the playground for other teams to jump into the core development of the project. April Aragon + Zug = \u2764 Aragon\u2019s legal entity and operations are moving to Zug, Switzerland We first met with the government of Zug a year ago, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s cofounder and Aragon\u2019s advisor Mihai Alisie. Mihai set up Ethereum Foundation\u2019s operations in Zug back in the day, and he was one of the early proponents of the Crypto Valley\u200a\u2014\u200aa vibrant crypto ecosystem across Switzerland and Lichtenstein\u200a\u2014\u200awith Zug at its epicenter. But Zug is a very special place for multiple reasons. Let\u2019s explore them. Aragon Team Update: March 2018 Written reviews of what the team members have been up to Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting. March Aragon Core v0.5\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201dThe Architect\u201d release The most powerful Aragon release to date We\u2019re extremely excited to be announcing the next major milestone of the Aragon project along with our brand new video! Team Interviews: Chris, Aragon\u2019s Product Manager Chris is joining the team to enhance the product development process even further Latest interviewee in our Team Interviews is Chris, Aragon\u2019s new Product Manager! We dive into his thoughts of how Ethereum and Aragon can help change the world for the better, what steps we can take to make creating Aragon an even better process and his philosophy on life. February Aragon Team Update: February 2018 Written reviews of what the team members have been up to Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine).

Aragon @ ETHDenver Recap An incredible weekend of building and bonding with the Denver community This past weekend several members of the Aragon team, including Jorge, Luke, Oliver, and myself (John), attended ETHDenver in Colorado, USA. ETHDenver is an Ethereum community event featuring a hackathon and workshops. Team Interviews: Jouni, Aragon\u2019s Design Lead Jouni is an experienced designer who\u2019s looking to change the future of society and work This time on Team Interviews Jouni, Aragon\u2019s new Design Lead! We get into his previous work designing open source software, what kind of impact technology can have on our global living environment and how he sees Ethereum and the blockchain technology potentially shaping the future of society and work. Team Interviews: Bingen, Aragon\u2019s Solidity Engineer Bingen is a developer and an open source advocate joining Aragon to make the world a better place Today our Team Interview is with Bingen, Aragon\u2019s new Solidity Engineer\u200a\u2014\u200awe talked about his interest to make the world a better place through Aragon, and what are his thoughts on Ethereum. Aragon at ETHDenver Aragon is a proud sponsor, mentor, and bounty provider at the ETHDenver hackathon For all of February 16\u201318, 2018 you can find several of Aragon team members at the ETHDenver hackathon. We\u2019re proud to be sponsoring this exciting event and are very much looking forward to seeing what people come up with there. Decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development Splitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon For the project to be as resilient as possible, the development of the project should not be controlled by a single central entity. It should be in the hands of the community and multiple different development teams. Announcing Aragon Labs Where research meets development The goal of Aragon Labs is to enable experimental research and development efforts that move fast and some times break (minor) things. Running these experiments allows us to learn from these experiences. And we can re-iterate and run these experiments for as long as we need.

As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. January Aragon comes back to the desktop Enhancing user experience while maximizing decentralization Before being a web application, Aragon was born as a desktop app. The line between a web and a desktop app is blurring and will eventually become invisible. Yet, as of today, web apps are still limited, especially in our ecosystem since users need to run software not supported by browsers. For example an IPFS node with its native and fast implementation. Final results from Aragon Network Vote #1 On January 26, 2019, Aragon Network Vote #1, the first vote held under the newly ratified Aragon Governance Proposal Process, concluded. Twelve proposals were submitted before the deadline, and nine were approved by the Aragon Association Board of Directors to move to the final ballot for a vote by ANT holders. Between January 24th and January 26th, ANT holders cast their votes to approve or reject the proposals on the ballot. Here are the final results from Aragon Network Vote #1. Aragon Monthly Issue 12 is out! The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem covering December 2018. Aragon Monthly was introduced a while back in my post Bringing DAOs back\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon Monthly and has since been a monthly aggregated source of News and Articles for people interested in decentralized organizations and governance. Final details for Aragon Governance Proposal Vote #1 Aragon Governance Proposal (AGP) Vote #1, the first vote held under the recently ratified Aragon Governance Proposal Process, is scheduled to begin on January 24, 2019 at 00:00 UTC. After a nearly two-month long period during which anyone could write and submit their own AGP for consideration - a period that was extended by one week following an emergency vote by the Aragon Association - a total of twelve proposals were submitted before the deadline. The Aragon Association reviewed and then voted to approve nine of those proposals, which will now move on to the official ballot to be voted on by ANT holders.

Aragon Q4 Development Update The progress of development from the fourth quarter of 2018. The fourth quarter of 2018, spanning the months of October to December, was all about shipping, iterating, and then more shipping. The period also coincided with many breakthroughs on our research, from scalable on-chain voting to a crystallization of the first version of the Aragon Network. The results have helped guide the Aragon project\u2019s product roadmap as well as the Flock proposals of Aragon One and the Aragon DAC. 5 Reasons We Made AraCon Less Than $200 AraCon is right around the corner.

November Upgrading Aragon Voting Part 1: The Ethereum Storage Time Machine Voting is at the core of what we do at Aragon. In this series of posts, we will introduce our latest research on how we intend to completely revamp Aragon's Voting infrastructure in order to achieve the above properties. In this first post, we will begin explaining the base of this new infrastructure, EVM Storage Proofs (aka 'The Ethereum Storage Time Machine'), a new technique we have developed that can be used to prove past storage values to other contracts. The future of organizations We believe that blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies are, at the core, a new way of organizing and unlocking human potential On this piece, we are going to touch briefly on the origin of companies and then we are going to focus on DAOs. We believe distributed organizations offer a potential solution to these issues as well as a good guiding compass for the future of companies. Trust Minimized Governance Tokens With the recent Mainnet release of Aragon, it\u2019s easier than ever to create an unstoppable organization and issue governance tokens. In this post I\u2019ll propose two potential mechanisms that would help minimize the trust required to use governance tokens by protecting the interests of minority and passive stakeholders without compromising self-sovereignty.

The Finance app is multi-token (plus ether). In order to remove the need of a trusted prices feed (oracle) for token exchange rate, every token is accounted on its own for budgeting and period financial statements. Definitions Accounting period Accounting periods are the equivalent of financial quarters in traditional organizations. Their length can be set depending on how the organization wants to use them. For every accounting period, a balance (called token statement) for every transacted token is kept, this balance will be negative if more was spent than deposited and positive if otherwise. Transactions A transaction records an event in which assets were deposited or spent through the Finance app. Spend transactions are called 'outgoing transactions' and deposits 'incoming transactions'. Every transaction occurs in an accounting period and counts towards its token statement. Transactions cannot be created directly, they are recorded as the result of an operation (either a payment being executed or a deposit made). Payments Payments are the construct used for spending using the Finance app. A payment can be created to happen only once or it can be a recurring payment that will be performed according to a certain time schedule. If executing a payment succeeds, it creates an outgoing transaction with a reference to the payment. Budgets Budgets give the ability to limit how much units of a token can be spent per Accounting period. Budgets are set in a token per token basis. By default no token has a budget, which means unlimited spending is allowed. Once a budget has been set for a token, the Finance app will only allow the budgeted amount of tokens to be spent for that period. Initialization Initializing a Finance app requires the following parameters: Vault: a reference to a Vault instance that the Finance app will use for depositing and spending tokens. In order for it to work correctly, the Finance app must have permissions to transfer Vault's tokens . Ether token : address of the EtherToken instance used as ether. Accounting period duration : the initial duration for accounting periods. Can later be changed for future periods. Lifecycle Deposits Two deposit mechanisms are supported: ERC20 token.approve(finance, amount) finance.deposit(token, amount, string reference) After doing an ERC20 approval with the Finance app as spender, calling deposit(...) will create an incoming transaction saving the reference string. ERC677 token.transferAndCall(finance, amount, string reference) Performing a ERC677 transferAndCall(...) to the Finance app will also trigger a deposit (intercepted with the tokenFallback ). The data passed as payload to transferAndCall is used directly as the reference for the deposit. Given that aragonOS' EtherToken implementation conforms to ERC677, depositing Ether to the Finance app can be done by wrapping the ether using etherToken.wrap() and then doing a transferAndCall(...) or using the shortcut wrapAndCall(...) which performs both actions. Please note that this section is subject to change as the ERC677 discussion evolves. Payments Depending on the parameters a payment is created with, it can be an instant one time payment, a recurrent payment for payroll or a scheduled payment. Creating payment finance.newPayment(...) A payment is created with the following parameters: Token : Address of token for payment. Receiver : Address that will receive payment. Amount : units of token that are payed every time the payment is due. Initial payment time : timestamp for when the first payment is done. Interval : number of seconds that need to pass between payment transactions. Maximum repeats : maximum instances a payment can be executed. In case a payment can already be executed on creation, it will be executed. If a payment is created that won't be repeated ever again, and already was executed, only an outgoing transaction is recorded to save storage. A payment can have a past initial payment time , which could cause many instances of the recurring payment to be executed at payment creation time. Executing payment finance.executePayment(uint256 _paymentId) finance.receiverExecutePayment(uint256 _paymentId) Payment execution will transfer the recipient of a payment the amount due depending on the current time. A single execution can result in multiple transactions if the payment hasn't been executed in time. To prevent it going out of gas when many transfers are due, a maximum amount of transfers are performed per execution (multiple executions could be needed in some instances). Payments can always be executed by its recipient, but there is also an additional role to the Finance app that allows another entity to execute the payment (recipient gets the funds in both instances). For payments whose token is the known EtherToken, instead of doing a token transfer, it will directly transfer ether to the recipient. A payment execution can fail in case the organization is out of budget for the payment token for that particular accounting period, or the organization doesn't have enough token balance. Disabling payments finance.setPaymentDisabled(uint256 _paymentId, bool _disabled) At any time, a payment can be disabled by an authorized entity. If a payment hasn't been fully executed until that time and it is disabled, the recipient won't be able to execute it until it is enabled again. Periods Setting duration finance.setPeriodDuration(uint64 _periodDuration) Sets the period duration for next periods. The current period duration cannot be modified. Setting budget finance.setBudget(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount) Updates the budget of a token for accounting periods. Newly set budget is automatically enforced for the current period. Removing budget finance.removeBudget(ERC20 _token) Removes budget for a token, allowing unlimited spending of that token in any period. Removing budget affects the current period. Transitioning periods finance.tryTransitionAccountingPeriod(uint ttl) All operations that can result in the creation of a transaction (creating a payment, executing a payment, performing a deposit) first check whether the accounting period needs to be transitioned (previous period has end time has passed) or it can be triggered manually by calling tryTransitionAccountingPeriod(...) . If many periods passed (last operation occurred two periods ago, but never transitioned), an empty period is created for every one of them. To prevent the case in which the Finance app cannot perform any operation because it needs to transition too many accounting periods, causing any operation to go out of gas, transitioning periods has a parameter for how many periods it will transition. Automatic transitions will only perform 10 transitions maximum, and if more were needed the operation will fail. In case this lock occurs and periods cannot be automatically transitioned, multiple period transitions operations can be triggered manually to remove the lockup. Limitations Payments are allowed to be created but can make it go out of budget. It can cause a race to execute payments right at the beginning of an Accounting period. Payment executions do not expire. There is an attack vector in which by not executing a payment in some time, a budget can be impacted when executed. In case this is happening, payment can be executed by another allowed entity or it could be disabled.","title":"Finance"},{"location":"dev/apps/finance/#finance","text":"Code in Github: aragon-apps/apps/finance The purpose of the Finance app is to be the central point for keeping track of income and expenses in an organization, as well as performing payments.

The sales that can be performed are simple capped sales with variable pricing over time. By tweaking some parameters, different sale dynamics can be achieved. More complex sale types can be implemented as 3rd party applications. Dependencies and permissions Token Manager : On initialization it requires a reference to a Token Manager instance. One fundraising app instance is only able to 'sell' the underlying token managed by its Token Manager . The fundraising app must be granted permissions to mint tokens on the Token Manager . The Token Manager must have been initialized in Native mode so it can arbitrarily mint new tokens (See Token Manager spec ). Vault : A reference to a vault is also required on initialization. However, there is no direct interaction with the vault, it is just used as the address where sale proceeds are deposited (vanilla ERC20 transfers). Both parameters are not modifiable after initialization. Definitions Inverse pricing : Given that there is no native support for floating point numbers in Solidity, we need to introduce the concept of inverse pricing to allow for prices that are below 1. Token decimals must be taken into account when setting prices. When inverse pricing is false in a sale, price means how many input tokens must be payed for each token being bought. That means the amount of tokens bought is calculated as boughtTokens = payedTokens / price . When inverse pricing is true , price means how many bought tokens are acquired per input token. boughtTokens = payedTokens * price Price periods : A sale will go through one or multiple periods during its lifecycle. Periods determine what the price is at any given moment during the sale. A period starts at the same timestamp when the previous period ended (or in the case of the first one, when the sale starts). A period has an initial and final price. If they are not the same, price for a given timestamp is linearly interpolated in function of time. Sales can have up to 50 periods. Caps : By default all sales are capped on two aspects, uncapping a sale can be done by setting it to a very large number. Setting one or both caps to UINT256_MAX should be interpreted by the client as being uncapped on that aspect. Max raised : Maximum amount of the token being raised that one sale accepts. Max sold : Maximum amount of tokens a sale can sell (max tokens minted). Sale lifecycle Creation fundraising.newSale(...) All sale parameters are set on initialization and cannot be changed. After a sale has been created, there is the option to force closing the sale (requires permissions). Sale parameters: Investor: Address of the entity allowed to buy in the sale. If the provided address is the 0th address ( 0x0000... ), then the sale is considered public and any address can buy. Raised token: Address of the token used for buy in the sale. Maximum raised: As explained in caps section. Maximum sold: As explained in caps section. Minimum buy: Minimum amount of raised token for a valid purchase. Is inverse price: Whether sale prices are expressed as inverse or not (as explained above). Sale start time: Timestamp for the start of the first period. Period ends array: Array of timestamps when each period ends (Minimum 1). Prices array: Array of prices for periods. Even though each period has two values, it is a one dimensional array. Example: [2, 3, 3, 5] means Period 1( initial price = 2, final price = 3) and Period 2 ( initial price = 3, final price = 5) Buy On every buy, the contract will calculate the price for the current timestamp based on the sale periods. If a given buy results in the sale capping (either maxRaised or maxSold), the contract will refund the buyer the amount contributed over the cap and the sale is closed. After every individual buy, all funds are sent to the vault. The fundraising contract should never have funds in between buys. Buy entrypoints Two methods are allowed for buying in sales: ERC20 fundraising.transferAndBuy(uint256 saleId, uint256 payedTokens) Requires the sender to have already created an ERC20 allowance equal or greater than payedTokens (could actually be less in the scenario some tokens are not allowed for cap reasons). ERC677 fundraising.buyTokens(uint256 saleId) // called by token Requires the sender to make a transferAndCall() as in the ERC677 standard (still evolving and being discussed), setting the fundraising app as receiver and adding the correct data payload. Raising ether can be done by setting the raised token to an EtherToken (ideally the one used by the Finance app for discoverability). Given that aragonOS' EtherToken implementation conforms to ERC677, buying with ether can be done by wrapping the ether using etherToken.wrap() and then doing a transferAndCall(...) or using the shortcut wrapAndCall(...) which performs both actions. Please note that this section is subject to change as the ERC677 discussion evolves. Closing sale fundraising.closeSale(uint256 _saleId) The sale is automatically closed either when a cap is reached or when the last period of the sale is over. Attempting to buy in a closed sale will fail. Limitations There is no concept of non-successful sale for lack of funding, therefore there are no refunds. In private sales, only one investor can buy.

The controller of a MiniMeToken is an address that can mint and destroy tokens, it also gets a 'hook' call on every transfer and approval giving the controller the chance to note it and decide whether to let the transfer through. Its most important features are minting new tokens and locking token transferability over time (vesting). One Token Manager instance can manage one MiniMe token. Modes Token Manager can handle two modes or use-cases. The mode is set on initialization and cannot be changed. Native token mode : The managed token can be minted arbitrarily. Wrapped token mode : The managed token acts as a wrapper to another ERC20 token. The managed token can only be minted by staking (wrapping) units of the wrapped token. At any time a holder of the wrapper token can exchange it back for the original token (unless there is vesting). Initialization There are two different initializers depending on the mode. Native tokenManager.initializeNative(address token) Parameters: Token : The token being managed. The Token Manager should have already been set as the controller for the token. Wrapped tokenManager.initializeWrapped(address wrapperToken, address wrappedToken) Parameters: Wrapper token : Same as token above. Wrapped token : Address of the token that will be wrapped Mode specific functionality Native mode Mint tokens tokenManager.mint(address receiver, uint256 amount) Creates new tokens and assigns them to the receiver. Issue tokens tokenManager.issue(uint256 amount) Creates new tokens that are assigned to the Token Manager. Those can be later assigned. Wrapper mode Wrapper mode works under the assumption that the wrapped token is a trusted ERC20 implementation, meaning transfers are performed normally (no fees on token transfers like) and balances constant if no operations are made. Wrap tokens tokenManager.wrap(uint256 amount) Requires an existing ERC20 allowance to the Token Manager address for at least that amount of tokens. It will transfer the wrapped tokens to the Token Manager and mint an equal amount of wrapper tokens for the sender. Will fail if sender hasn't created the allowance or doesn't have enough wrapped token balance. Unwrap tokens tokenManager.unwrap(uint256 amount) It will burn the wrapper tokens and transfer the user the same amount in wrapped tokens. Will fail if sender doesn't own that many tokens. Generic functionality Assign tokens tokenManager.assign(address receiver, uint256 amount) Transfers tokens from Token Manager balance to receiver . Token Manager can own tokens as a result of an issue operation on native mode or just because the Token Manager received a normal token transfer. Assign vested tokens tokenManager.assignVested(address receiver, uint256 amount, { Vesting parameters }) Performs an assign but attaches rules on when the receiver can transfer her tokens. Next section goes in depth into how vesting works. Revoke vesting tokenManager.revokeVesting(address holder, uint256 vestingId) Revokes a vesting from a holder (if vesting is revokable). Vesting Assigning tokens with vesting performs a normal ERC20 token transfer operation but then the holder will only be able to perform transfers according to a vesting calendar. MiniMe tokens perform a check with their controller before doing a token transfer. This hook is used by the Token Manager to check whether a holder can transfer the desired tokens. By making the holders the direct owners of the tokens, they are able to use tokens for actions that check the token balance such as voting, while at the same time being able to lock transferability of them. Vested holders are also allowed to forward transactions through the TokenManager. Vesting parameters Start: timestamp in seconds that marks the beginning of the vesting schedule (can be a past or future date). Cliff: timestamp for the first moment in which any assigned tokens can be transferred. The amount of tokens that gets unlocked in the cliff is directly proportional to the overall vesting schedule. Vesting: timestamp for the moment all tokens assigned are transferable. Revokable: whether the Token Manager can revoke a token grant in the middle of the vesting. When that happens, tokens that are not vested yet are transferred back to the Token Manager. Calculating transferable tokens A token holder can have multiple vestings at the same time. For checking whether an amount of tokens can be transferred, the contract will check for all the vestings a holder has how many tokens can be transferred at that moment (note that some of the tokens may have been assigned without vesting). For every vesting, the amount: From start to cliff, 0 tokens are transferable. From cliff to vesting, the amount of transferable tokens is interpolated using this formula: transferable = tokens * (now - start) / (vesting - start) After vesting, all tokens are transferrable. Forwarder Token Manager allows holders of its underlying token to execute external actions by identifying themselves as token holders. This can be used for allowing token holders to perform a particular action in the DAO (e.g create a vote) without the ACL having to know anything about tokens. For this, Token Manager conforms to the aragonOS Forwarder interface and forwards calls to holders that own at least one token. Limitations In order to avoid an attack in which too many token vestings are added to a holder to cause an out of gas, the amount of token vestings a holder is limited to 50.","title":"Token Manager"},{"location":"dev/apps/token-manager/#token-manager","text":"Code in Github: aragon-apps/apps/token-manager Token Manager is an abstraction layer over the concept of the MiniMeToken controller.

A Note on Percentages If you are a front end user you can skip this section, but if you are a developer and want to manipulate the Voting contract directly these are some notes you should consider. The variables \"Support required\" and \"Minimum acceptance quorum\" are percentages that are expressed between zero and a maximum of 10^18 (that represents 100%). As a consequence, it's important to consider that 1% is actually represented by 10^16.

A generic forward action will create a vote with the provided execution script and empty metadata. When a vote is created a reference to the previous block number is saved as the snapshot block for the vote. The reason the previous block number is used is to avoid double voting in the same block the vote is created. Whenever a vote is casted, the MiniMeToken associated with the app is checked for the token balance of the voter at the snapshot block. Casting votes votingApp.vote(uint256 _voteId, bool _supports) In order for casting a vote all these conditions must be met: Sender had a positive token balance in the token at the vote snapshot block.

Aragon team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member or contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Reporting If you are being harassed by a member of the Aragon community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Aragon Chat admins @light or @tatu at Aragon Chat . If the person who is harassing you is one of these admins, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as possible. This code of conduct applies to Aragon community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Aragon community or team member outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Aragon community or team members seriously. This includes harassment outside of our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The team reserves the right to exclude people from the Aragon community at their discretion, based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Aragon spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Aragon community. In order to protect the Aragon team from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Aragon community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. Scope This Code of Conduct applies both within the Aragon project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include presenting themselves as Aragon community members, promoting the Aragon project as well as using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by the Aragon team. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Aragon projects team at Aragon Chat . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Aragon team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. Aragon community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the Aragon team. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Aragon response team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Aragon project spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Aragon community members or the general public. Admins/moderators must recuse themselves from moderation decisions regarding a community member they may have a conflict of interest with, delegating moderation decisions to an un-involved moderator or Aragon Association executive. Aragon.Chat Aragon project's chat channels descriptions tell you what is considered proper on-topic discussion on that channel, we want everyone to abide by these discussion topics, but using common sense is allowed.

Aragon organizations are easily customizable, and they are also extensible by installing third party apps. Aragon organizations will be able to opt-in into the Aragon Network, which will provide services like a decentralized court arbitration system for them.

Firms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or provide services. However, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of those organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks. Aragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other organizational structures. Luis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper The Nature of the Firm and Yochai Benkler's Linux and the Nature of the Firm . Both explore the concept of companies. At Aragon, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives for companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that will take advantage of these changes. However, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they are easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes. We want to solve\u2014either us or partnering with others\u2014those points in order to make decentralized organizations widespread. And, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points. Organizational Structure Aragon Community , defining the community members contributing to the dapp and Network and the Aragon Network Token holders. Aragon Association , from now on, the Association , a non-profit organization based in Switzerland, will serve as the umbrella organization responsible for allocating resources to other bodies for future cryptocurrency research and development going forward. The board of the Association consists of Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo. The Association will focus on overarching the mission and will enable operating organizations to accomplish the day-to- day work. The Association will also serve as a governance entity that will listen the Community until the Aragon Network is fully operational, from where the full governance of the Network will be transferred to the ANT holders. Aragon One AG , a Swiss for-profit corporation that serves the Association and employs the first team that will work on the Aragon platform and the Aragon Network. Development Milestones We will divide development milestones in the form of releases. Each release may have multiple deployment stages, from being in alpha stage\u2014running on the test network\u2014to begin in the production stage\u2014running on the main network\u2014going through multiple testing, security and QA stages. 0.1 \u2014 The Initial Release This the first release on macOS after months of work and weeks of privately-conducted community testing. Featured all the basic functionality that an organization needs to operate. It was not made public. Release Calendar Private Alpha : February 2017 Release link 0.2 \u2014 The Public Release This was the first public release. Working in both macOS, Linux and Windows. Introduced a new UI styling and Kovan testnet support. For more information, read the launch post . Release Calendar Alpha : February 2017 Release link 0.3 \u2014 The Governance Release This version added the Bring your own token functionality, that allows using Aragon with any ERC20 token as a governance token\u2014ERC20 is a token standard allows everyone to interface with a variety of tokens in a common way. It also added two new bylaws, specific address only and ask oracle contract for confirmation\u2014stepping stone for more dynamic bylaws. It introduced delegate voting and creation of custom, complex stock classes. It featured new iconography, notable startup time improvements and web browser support for using it with Ethereum browsers/clients like Mist, Parity, MetaMask, Status etc. Release Calendar Alpha : April 2017 Release link 0.4 \u2014 The Bridge Release This release will focus on adding: Economic abstraction Companies will be able to hold and interact with any standard value-holding token Improved budgeting and accounting Organizations will be in itself the organization's bank account . Dividends Dividend sharing with shareholders, if desired. Fundraising tokens Company will be able to raise funds in the form of tokens, not necessarily ether. More flexible founding routes. Funds vault Final funds vault API, the only part of the company that is not expected to change. This will make upgradeability easier, being able to redeploy significant parts of the organization while maintaining its access to the funds. Release Calendar Alpha : July 2017 Release link : Deprecated due to refactor for Aragon 0.3 This will be a development version only focusing on smart contracts, iterating between different models for upgradeability, extensibility and security.\u2029 0.5 \u2014 The Architect Release This release will consist of a total refactor, and will focus on adding: Organization-wide identity Entities in organizations will be able to register their own usernames in the organization, and also provide offchain metadata for displaying purposes in the UI. Full upgradeability Organizations that will be able to run as long as the Ethereum blockchain runs. No matter if big chunks of functionality are swapped. Totally new permission system Extensible permission system to allow any entity to interact with another one using an ACL (Access Control List) that the kernel controls and maintains. Switch to an exokernel architecture By making the kernel a very simple contract that just keeps the ACL and keep references to the installed apps, we can make it more secure and reduce the lines of code and complexity in apps, since there can be multiple instances of an app, also making upgradeability easier. Front-end apps API This will let developers build modules for Aragon that extend its functionality. We will provide an API for developers to access functionality from the Aragon client, and a UI toolkit for them to adhere to our styling and UX patterns. Core apps API The API will let the developer trigger actions inside the organization itself, and access more low-level capabilities. Decentralized package management By creating the Aragon Package Manager , which is a decentralized organization built on Aragon itself, we enable the frontend and smart contracts to be seamlessly upgraded by using any governance mechanism compatible with aragonOS. Human readable transactions Thanks to our work on Radspec , the Aragon interface can show users a human readable description of the actions the users take on the app. Support for templates Templates allow users to bootstrap organizations with the proper permissions to replicate multiple existing models such a startup, a democracy, an open source community... with just a click. Survey app on mainnet The Survey app is an app built on Aragon that enables token holders to signal their support to different proposal. The first one is live on the mainnet now at https://survey.aragon.org . Blockchain projects that have already manifested interest Release Calendar Alpha : April 2018 Bug bounty (mainnet) : From May 2017 to July 2018 Beta (mainnet) : August 2018 Release link This will be the first release that gets deployed to the mainnet. After months of public bug bounties in the mainnet, we will start allowing the first organizations to be created using Aragon in the mainnet. 0.6 \u2014 The Sweet Release This release will focus on adding: Permissions app This app will allow stakeholders to read and alter permissions on the organization, by using the modular permission system established by aragonOS. Identity component The identity component will replace all Ethereum addresses with easy to understand identity icons and names for user friendliness, and also serve to autocomplete entities while interacting with the app. Stability fixes Fix bugs and possible issues, both for users and also developers using our developer tools to create Aragon apps. Release Calendar Beta (mainnet) : August 2018 0.7 \u2014 The Network Release This release will focus on adding: Basic network-wide governance Which power the network will have over organizations, governance votings to decide on service providers, payouts functionality. App center The App center will allow third party apps to be installed in Aragon in order to enable different organizations to address different needs. Any aragonOS-compatible app will be able to be installed, and recommendations will be given to users. ANT token minting The network will be responsible for the minting policy of ANT, it will be decided through the governance of the network. Some of its responsibilities will be to decide the minting rate, the price and how companies pay for the subscription to the network. Integrate upgradeability Provide upgradeability as a network service for all Aragon Network organizations. Release Calendar Alpha : November 2018 Bug bounty (mainnet) : December 2018 Production deploy (mainnet) : January 2019 0.8 \u2014 The Court Release This release will focus on adding: Aragon Jurisdiction Provide a decentralized court, Aragon Jurisdiction, as network service or work with a decentralized court project to make it work with the network. Orgs in the AN respond to ANJ Organizations in the Aragon Network start being under the Aragon Jurisdiction. Constitution proposal First proposal for the basic laws that all organizations will be act under. Release Calendar Alpha : Q1 2019 Bug bounty (mainnet) : Q2 2019 Production deploy (mainnet) : Q3 2019\u2029 0.9 \u2014 The Unknown Release This is a wildcard release. The ecosystem is evolving very quickly and we don't know what interesting features we may want to add that will make the 1.0 release more appealing. Some ideas of what we might work on here: Privacy-focused companies zkSnarks could provide companies with way more privacy. Private voting and ownership are very interesting concepts we are researching about. Different governance mechanisms We are closely following research and experimentation on other governance mechanisms such as Futarchy . 1.0 \u2014 The Release We expect to start marketing Aragon to the mainstream with this release. To achieve that mission, we will have to place an important focus on design and user experience.","title":"Development Plan"},{"location":"documentation/Development_Plan/#development-plan","text":"**This development plan has been deprecated in favor of the project roadmap . version 1.2","title":"Development Plan"},{"location":"documentation/Development_Plan/#introduction","text":"Aragon is everything you need to run organizations (companies, NGOs, associations, open source projects...) on the Ethereum blockchain.

After the launch of the Aragon Network, it will also be possible to use ANT to collateralize agreements made by members of the Aragon Network. More information about the use of ANT in the Aragon Network can be found in the Aragon Network whitepaper . Initial token distribution ANT was initially created and distributed as a result of a public token sale that took place on May 17, 2017 - starting at Ethereum block 3,723,000 to be exact. Less than 100 blocks later, 275,000 ETH worth of ANT were sold. Added together with ANT sold in the pre-sale, ANT granted to the Aragon Foundation/Association, and ANT granted to founders and early contributors, the total initial supply of ANT after the token sale is 39,609,523.80952380954 ANT.

As Aragon co-founder Jorge Izquierdo wrote on the Aragon blog: We decided to use MiniMe as the base token for ANT because it offers flexibility, security, and a clear upgrade path. The MiniMe Token is an ERC20 token created by the Giveth team that maintains a history of balances and is easily cloned to create independent tokens with unique functionality (shout out to the Giveth team, definitely one of the best Solidity development teams out there). In addition, MiniMe is a great token standard for governance because it keeps track of balances at the time of starting a proposal vote. This removes the need to lock balances after voting to prevent double voting. With all of its benefits, we\u2019re considering making MiniMe the default token for all Aragon organizations.

A pledge to fight for freedom We believe the fate of humanity will be decided at the frontier of technological innovation. We will either see technology lead to a more free, open, and fair society or reinforce a global regime of centralized control, surveillance, and oppression. Our fear is that without a global, conscious, and concerted effort, the outlook is incredibly bleak. The Internet has opened the doors for universal, cross-border, and non-violent collaborative effort to fight for our freedom . However, the Internet has also opened the doors for global surveillance and manipulation. We believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another. Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies. Decentralized technologies provide users unparalleled power to transact and interact with a level of security never seen before. Thanks to cryptography and economic incentives, users can now own truly sovereign assets, create fully sovereign entities, and build truly sovereign identities. They solidify freedoms that cannot be taken away, not even by actors with sizeable resources. This tectonic shift requires a new method for organizing these sovereign individuals: decentralized organizations. For the first time in history, thanks to blockchain technology and smart contracts, we can now create fully decentralized organizations, which are truly autonomous and unstoppable. Decentralized organizations change our relationship with governance : from something that is imposed upon us by others, into something we choose to opt into. Where we are equally serving and served, rather than just serving. Building tools to create and manage decentralized organizations will unleash a Cambrian explosion of new governance forms, and the competition among them will raise the bar globally. It will finally allow us to experiment with governance at the speed of software. Instead of complaining about how badly incentives are set in the world and how poorly resources are allocated, we will have the power to create systems that better align incentives and distribute resources. This is the Enlightenment of the century. Sovereign individuals will be able to freely express themselves and transact with each other without any kind of intermediary exercising their unjustified power and oppressing them. This may be one of the most important revolutions humanity has ever faced. We need to be careful about how we go about it. Technology can be a double-edged sword. We need to explicitly set out the values that Aragon stands for , in order for our community to always uphold and defend them . We are committed to building organizational forms that defend self-sovereignty\u200a\u2014\u200awhere a user can always exercise choice, either by participating or exiting. In today's world, our governing power over society's common goods is negligible. Even for exercising small changes over your environment (your city, state or corporation), you might have to go through cumbersome and opaque bureaucratic processes. This happens because the coordination costs were high in the old world. But now, thanks to the Internet and decentralized governance, we can, and must, engineer systems to empower the people's voice to their fullest potential. Also, if you dislike those broken governance processes, you cannot easily exit from them . Some organizations own your identity (governments), some others own your data (Facebook), and some others even own the path for you to exit (borders), restricting your choice of leaving. We must build organizational structures that allow users to exit with minimal friction if they fundamentally disagree with the governance of those structures. We are committed to creating collaboration mechanisms in which violence is not only disincentivized, but impossible. Choices can only be made freely in the absence of coercion and extortion. Systems should never use violence as a means to incentivize or disincentivize human behavior. With cryptonetworks, we can create environments where others cannot even tell where individuals are located or what they look like. We must make violence in these cryptonetworks impossible by protecting users' privacy with cryptography. We are committed to decentralizing power in order to dismantle unjustified power\u200a\u2014\u200awhich usually springs from centralization. Power has a natural tendency to reinforce itself and become corrupt. If power becomes centralized, it doesn't have to answer to anyone but itself. Decentralizing power is essential to minimizing corruption over time. We must strive to create systems in which a large number of diverse stakeholders have a say, in order for common goods to be responsibly governed by their communities. We are committed to the creation of long-term value versus short-term profit\u200a\u2014\u200awhich in turn, advances sustainability. We want these values to last. We are in this for the long run. In order to make lasting impact and disrupt existing power structures, we must create systems that provide sustainable economic value to their participants. We must honor and encourage the communities that sustain Aragon itself, and we must do so by rewarding those who defend the values outlined in this manifesto. We are committed to a world in which every person can participate in these new organizational structures. We seek to use technology to lift people from oppression. To be successful, we must keep our products open, understandable, and easy to use for everyone. Aragon Association Pledge The Aragon Association is a non-profit entity that safeguards the values of the project. Specifically, the Aragon Association pledges to support the Aragon Manifesto by: Building free, libre, open source technology to allow the creation and management of decentralized organizations Experimenting with new governance models that comply with the Manifesto's values Creating a cryptonetwork for decentralized organizations to thrive (the Aragon Network ) Building a community that defends the Manifesto's values Using the token sale proceeds to fund teams that uphold and defend these values, in order for them to carry and accomplish all the aforementioned tasks Working alongside other entities that pledge to support decentralized technologies and build the underlying infrastructure needed for decentralized organizations to flourish Use all of its assets, including proceeds from the token sale, intellectual property, and brand to maintain, spread and defend the above values We consider this Manifesto an alpha , and look forward to the community's feedback to evolve it over time to a definitive version.

Building tools to create and manage decentralized organizations will unleash a Cambrian explosion of new governance forms, and the competition among them will raise the bar globally. It will finally allow us to experiment with governance at the speed of software. Instead of complaining about how badly incentives are set in the world and how poorly resources are allocated, we will have the power to create systems that better align incentives and distribute resources. This is the Enlightenment of the century. Sovereign individuals will be able to freely express themselves and transact with each other without any kind of intermediary exercising their unjustified power and oppressing them. This may be one of the most important revolutions humanity has ever faced. We need to be careful about how we go about it. Technology can be a double-edged sword.

Further audits and public bug bounty programs are scheduled to begin in early January 2018. All the changes triggered as result of the audit can be found in the aragonOS and aragon-apps repos The original PDF report has been converted to Markdown for easier reading. You can download unmodified report from the auditor here: Download original PDF The repository aragon-core has been renamed to aragonOS after this audit took place and that change has been reflected in this document. See the PDF file above for the untouched original report. Introduction This audit report was undertaken by @adamdossa for the purpose of providing feedback to Aragon. It has been written without any express or implied warranty. The review focussed on the Solidity contract code in these repos, and covered: possible attack vectors mismatches between logic and documentation possible code improvements confusing functionality or naming The review was performed using the code tagged with audit1 at the following commits. aragonOS : https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/audit1/contracts aragon-apps : https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/audit1/apps We used RocketChat to coordinate the review and help resolve questions during the review process. Overview Overall the code structure was readable, well-documented and structured coherently and consistently. Functions largely conform to the best practices at: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html making the structure and code easy to parse and understand. The codebase also included comprehensive testing suites, using the Truffle testing framework. The Aragon team also employs a coverage framework and linter process to ensure their code remains consistent and testing comprehensive. The team was responsive, measured and prompt in their responses and feedback during the process. General Comments There were a few functions that were missing explicit function visibility modifiers. This has been reviewed and corrected (including linter updates) via: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/pull/33 In addition to the below there are a few miscellaneous fixes and improvements that have been made, including additional testing coverage and minor fixes. These include: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/49253097831a6f979c68c309ae0c6c00c325af4d https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/c239847065eebb2f2b3ea2dbc264b8a25cd788cd as well as many other incremental improvements which have been made during and after this audit process. aragonOS/contracts/kernel These contracts form the core Kernel implementation. The Kernel manages app and Kernel permissions and provides a layer of indirection to access apps (allowing apps, including the Kernel, to be upgraded as necessary). Issues There were a few areas of the documentation which were either out-dated, or possibly confusing. These included: description of Grant Permission which has now been amended to make the conditions of this operation clearer. making the separation between instantiation and initialisation clearer. correcting some minor mistakes in the example code for Create Permission These issues have now been resolved in a number of pull requests: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/32b6f1cfb396c8974a2be4e925111e33dbe9b275 https://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/b2cde71d3faa8212a3124813901b8d5280d93c76 https://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/c3a734c651a04052cea0dc80753079a4a6a9ab82 Possible Improvements Some possible future improvements were identified, specifically: events being triggered when permissions were used. managing the instantiation / initialisation of contracts (see below section for more details). continuing to work on documentation to make the permission framework as clear as possible. aragonOS/contracts/apps and aragonOS/contracts/common These contracts contains the logic required for both proxy contracts (which allow the underlying \"business logic\" contracts to be upgraded) and forwarding (which allows entities to forward transaction scripts to other entities for execution). Issues Pre-Byzantium logic could now be removed from DelegateProxy as returndatasize opcodes are now available. This has now been resolved via: https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/145 The use of delegatecall to execute underlying App logic is a clever way of preserving state and Ether value in the DelegateProxy whilst using the code / business logic of an upgradable App contract. The below represent areas that could be clarified in the documentation, rather than bugs in the code. Since the App code is expected to have state / storage, this imposes a limitation that any new upgraded version of the App has a superset of the previous contract which it is replacing. Since state is maintained in the DelegateProxy contract, not the underlying App contract, this may cause some practical issues with third-party apps such as exchanges or etherscan.io (for example I don't believe the \"Read Contract\" functionality on etherscan.io would work as the ABI wouldn't have the relevant functions on the DelegateProxy contract, and the state on the App contract wouldn't reflect updates). There were a few areas of documentation which use inconsistent terminology (e.g. scaling vs. forwarding) which have been resolved via: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/c3a734c651a04052cea0dc80753079a4a6a9ab82 One of the identified issues related to the instantiation and initialisation of AppProxy contracts not being atomic. In the expected use-cases, where AppProxy contracts are instantiated and initialised through a factory process (within a single atomic transaction) this is not problematic, but there is some potential for this structure to be abused in unexpected use-cases, allowing a malicious user to front-run AppProxy contracts. The Aragon team discussed various options internally and an approach was implemented to allow an optional initializePayload to be passed to the AppProxy constructor, which can be used to initialise the contract as part of its instantiation. https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/148 Possible Improvements Given the use of delegatecall , the documentation could clarify the intention as to whether App contracts are designed to be used as factory contracts, or redeployed for each Aragon organisation. It may be sensible to make the 10000 gas in AppProxy a variable that can be modified to account for any future changes to opcode gas costs for delegatecall . aragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts This contract allows votes to take place on arbitrary actions, using the MiniMeToken to determine voting power of token holders. Issues The VoterState of Absent doesn't seem to be used anywhere - not sure if this is in for some future purpose perhaps, if not it could be removed. The Voting app automatically executed a vote payload once the outcome of the vote was beyond doubt. Whilst this is useful functionality, it made it hard for a voter to estimate gas requirements and the effect of their vote transaction deterministically (as the outcome depended on whether or not the vote tipped the balance). A boolean parameter has now been introduced to allow a voter to specify whether or not they want their vote to automatically execute the vote payload (if appropriate) via: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/ae8a92e05c9bb90892da24e09ba1354fe49514ac Possible improvements Currently the duration of a vote is fixed on initialisation of the Voting contract - it may be worth considering making this a per-Vote variable instead to allow for both long and short-dated votes. Since the _minAcceptQuorumPct can be modified during the lifetime of the contract, it may be that users also want to change voteTime as well. The event CastVote should include the number of votes being cast to allow easier off-chain tracking of vote status. This has now been resolved via: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/8ea8cda2d190a695d2a7ec0d7680c4c8bafd5054 When modifying the _minAcceptQuorumPct through changeMinAcceptQuorumPct it may be worth emitting an event for this change. This has now been resolved via: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/03f26441f60a4dedd042749972218fb6dadaa9de When creating a new vote through the forward method, it may be worth putting a non-blank _metadata in to make it clearer to track where the vote has come from. This could incorporate the forwarding entities address. aragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts This contract manages token actions through the MiniMeToken contract (either wrapping another token, or natively). Issues canForward allows holders of tokens which have not yet vested to forward request - this may be intentional, but worth clarifying in the documentation. It is technically possible for a single TokenManager to be set as the controller for multiple MiniMeToken contracts. It may be worth asserting in the TokenController functions ( onApprove , onTransfer , proxyPayment ) that msg.sender matches the expected token value, to avoid any misconfiguration. Possible Improvements The vesting model follows broadly the Zeppelin approach. In my experience clients have often wanted a simpler model with a single cliff date, upon which all tokens vest. This is not possible to achieve with the implemented approach as the tokens must vest linearly between the start and vesting dates (with nothing vesting before the cliff date). It may be worth mentioning in the documentation that it is important to set the controller in the MiniMeToken to be the TokenManager (i.e. that it isn't sufficient to initialise the TokenManager with the MiniMeToken but that the link needs to go both ways). aragon-apps/apps/group/contracts This contract acts as a simple way to permission a group of entities as a single entity. Issues In the documentation, there is a minor grammatical mistake - the phrase \"This is needed for identification purposes, given that the only other context the group possesses.\" should perhaps be \"This is needed for identification purposes, given that it is the only context the group possesses.\". aragon-apps/apps/fundraising/contracts This contract is responsible for raising funds (in any ERC20 token, which could include wrapped Ether) in return for a new ERC20 token. Issues In line 297, it should be (period.finalPrice != initialPrice) rather than (period.finalPrice != 0) . From the documentation, it says: \"A period has an initial and final price. If they are not the same, price for a given timestamp is linearly interpolated in function of time.\" This has now been resolved via: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/49253097831a6f979c68c309ae0c6c00c325af4d In function _buy the calculation of returnAmount is subject to rounding errors I believe. i.e. in the isInversePrice case, if dividing by pricePrecision leads to rounding, then re-multiplying by pricePrecision may not yield the expected value. This is an issue that is worth being aware of, but is unlikely to lead to any genuine problems. The initialize function could check that the TokenManager is running in native (rather than wrapped) mode by checking the public variable _tokenManager.wrappedToken == 0 . Having getCurrentPrice behave differently on a call / sendTransaction may be confusing. You could refactor this so that it is genuinely a constant function instead. I agree that functionally this works as transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded is always called before any other state modifying functions execute. calculatePrice has an implicit dependency on transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded being called before it is used. This could be enforced in the function (e.g. by checking that the current timestamp is between sale.periodStartTime and sale[currentPeriod].periodEnds . This is redundant in the current code (since transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded is always called before calculatePrice but would make it harder to make errors in the future, or in derived contracts). This has now been resolved via: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/c239847065eebb2f2b3ea2dbc264b8a25cd788cd Possible Improvements Adding a token purchase function which allows a beneficiary address (rather than msg.sender ) to receive tokens may be useful. Having the ability to associate a script to be called on a sale closing may be useful. This script could for example ensure that no more tokens could be minted (effectively capping the issued tokens supply) by revoking MINT_ROLE permissions from the TokenManager , or allow the FundRaising contract to transfer CREATE_SALES_ROLE permission to a different entity (i.e. a VotingApp associated with the token being issued). Maybe worth making the distinction between tokens being raised, and tokens being issued clearer through consistent variable naming. Tracking which variables correspond to raisedToken and which correspond to tokens being issued was confusing (maybe consistently call this raisedToken and issuedToken or similar). i.e. uint256 returnTokens = ... could become uint256 returnRaisedTokens = ... , _payedTokens could become _paidRaisedTokens , _value in tokenFallback could become _paidRaisedToken , sale.minBuy would become sale.minRaised and so on. I'm not sure what the motivation to have multiple (potentially concurrent) ongoing sales is? I guess if you wanted to raise from a mix of tokens that would make sense (as each Sale could have a different raisedToken ), but in this case you wouldn't have a consolidated cap etc., which would make it confusing. I can see that it may be required to have a follow-on sale, but wonder whether having each sale being represented by a new FundRaisingProxy may be simpler / clearer. aragon-apps/apps/finance/contracts This contract is responsible for tracking transactions (payments or deposits) across an organisations token balances, and managing scheduled payments. Given the importance of this contract and the value there would be in exploiting it, it may be worth having this specific contract be audited separately by multiple individuals and / or placing a bounty within a live deployment to encourage investigation. Issues Any reason why the minimum payment duration is 2, rather than 1: require(_periodDuration 1); I can see that you use settings.periodDuration - 1 as the duration length, but not clear why you don't just use settings.periodDuration (with the requirement that settings.periodDuration 0 ); In both tokenFallback , and deposit the _token.transferFrom and token.transfer methods could potentially re-enter the Finance app. I can't immediately see how this can cause an issue, but worth being aware of. It may be worth mentioning in the documentation that payments can be \"back-dated\", in which case the receiver will be eligible to execute all \"back-dated\" payments. This has now been resolved via: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/b2cde71d3faa8212a3124813901b8d5280d93c76 If the budget for a token is reduced during a period (via setBudget ) it is possible that _getRemainingBudget may throw if the amount already spent ( periods[currentPeriodId()].tokenStatement[_token].expenses ) is larger than the new budget (in which case settings.budgets[_token].sub(spent) will throw). It may be better to return 0 rather than throwing in this case. _makePaymentTransaction could record the payment reference in the corresponding transaction reference. Possible Improvements There are no restrictions on what ERC20 tokens can be used for deposits. This would allow an attacker to create an ERC20 token which always returns true on _token.transferFrom without actually depositing any tokens. Whilst this isn't really an issue it would be possible to bloat the transactions array. Not sure there is really an easy solution to this, although having an optional \"whitelist\" of allowed token addresses that can be deposited is an option. aragon-apps/apps/vault/contracts This contract is used to store an organisations tokens (and wrapped Ether). Any actual balances will be held in the corresponding AppProxy contract. This is a nice and simple contract, with no obvious issues. Possible Improvements Potentially integrating this contract with the Finance contracts budget functionality. In other words setting a budget in the Finance app could require a corresponding allowance in the Vault app for the given token.","title":"Audit 01 by Adam Dossa"},{"location":"documentation/audits/audit01_report_dossa/#aragon-05-audit-by-adam-dossa","text":"This was the initial review of the aragonOS system that powers the v0.5 release of Aragon.

This is an issue that is worth being aware of, but is unlikely to lead to any genuine problems. The initialize function could check that the TokenManager is running in native (rather than wrapped) mode by checking the public variable _tokenManager.wrappedToken == 0 . Having getCurrentPrice behave differently on a call / sendTransaction may be confusing. You could refactor this so that it is genuinely a constant function instead. I agree that functionally this works as transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded is always called before any other state modifying functions execute. calculatePrice has an implicit dependency on transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded being called before it is used. This could be enforced in the function (e.g. by checking that the current timestamp is between sale.periodStartTime and sale[currentPeriod].periodEnds . This is redundant in the current code (since transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded is always called before calculatePrice but would make it harder to make errors in the future, or in derived contracts).

Maybe worth making the distinction between tokens being raised, and tokens being issued clearer through consistent variable naming. Tracking which variables correspond to raisedToken and which correspond to tokens being issued was confusing (maybe consistently call this raisedToken and issuedToken or similar). i.e. uint256 returnTokens = ... could become uint256 returnRaisedTokens = ... , _payedTokens could become _paidRaisedTokens , _value in tokenFallback could become _paidRaisedToken , sale.minBuy would become sale.minRaised and so on. I'm not sure what the motivation to have multiple (potentially concurrent) ongoing sales is? I guess if you wanted to raise from a mix of tokens that would make sense (as each Sale could have a different raisedToken ), but in this case you wouldn't have a consolidated cap etc., which would make it confusing.

This means that in delegatedFwd(target, msg.data) , target could potentially be delegating to a malicious contract. As far as I know, exploiting this would be extremely difficult, but it should be clear in the surrounding documentation that the kernel MUST be carefully set. KernelProxy should fail on construction if _kernelImpl is not a contract aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol : delegatedFwd(kernelImpl, msg.data) will always fail if kernelImpl == 0 or is not a contract. In such a case, it would also be impossible to run upgradeKernel() . KernelProxy s' initialization can be front-runned: aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol : initialize() is public and accessible to anyone after the proxy is deployed. This should at least be highlighted in documentation for Kernel.initialize() and the KernelProxy so as to make sure users always create and initialize these proxies in one atomic transaction, but a better solution would be to introduce the same initializePayload that is in AppProxy . Kernel.revokePermission() can be front-runned: aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol : There are many possible outcomes when revokePermission() races with an entity wishing to perform an action associated with the revoked role. As in all front-running cases, the entity learning of the revocation has the upper hand as he can send his transactions with much higher gas prices. I don't see any good way around this, as this is a pretty general problem plaguing all systems implementing revocable controls. It may be a good idea to note this in the comments and associated documentation. The best way around the problem is just to never give permissions to an entity you don't entirely trust, but this is obviously not very practical (yet). Low-severity APMRegistry.NewRepo event should index its id and repo fields aragonOS/contracts/apm/ApmRegistry.sol Repo should use pragma solidity 0.4.18; aragonOS/contracts/apm/Repo.sol AppProxy should fail if _appId is bytes32(0) aragonOS/contracts/apps/AppProxy.sol : A valid appId will never be bytes32(0) AragonApp could be split into AragonApp and InitializableAragonApp aragonOS/contracts/apps/AragonApp.sol : Apps that don't need to initialize don't need to inherit from Initializable . However, doing this would make it difficult for an app to include the ability to initialize later on, although it's debatable whether or not that functionality would be desirable (what does it mean for already created apps if the app changes to require initialization?). EtherToken 's wrap() , wrapAndCall() , and withdraw() should be made external aragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol : I don't see many use cases for subclassing this contract (since it's specific to ETH) so any functions not used internally could be made external EtherToken 's wrap() could also take a receiver address aragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol : Seems odd that wrap() always deposits to the msg.sender while wrapAndCall() allows you to choose who to send it to EtherToken.withdraw() includes an unnecessary check: aragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol : Strictly speaking, require(balances[msg.sender] = _amount) is unnecessary since balances[msg.sender].sub(_amount) will also do this check DelegateProxy.delegatedFwd() could take a gas parameter: aragonOS/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol : It may be useful to provide a control over how much gas is provided to the delegatecall in case of gas price changes or particular uses (e.g. super large returns or gas-restricted calls). I don't think this is a pressing concern, however, and it may be suggesting additional flexibility for the sake of flexibility. IForwarder.isForwarder() should be made external aragonOS/contracts/common/IForwarder.sol : There's no reason to ever use isForwarder() internally... right? Initializable library instances can be initialized: aragonOS/contracts/common/Initializable.sol : Not a big deal because library contracts' states are meaningless, but it'd still be nice if Initializable provided a way for these library contracts to be initialized on creation (e.g. by providing a constructor that sets initializationBlock ) ENSSubdomainRegistrar.createNameAndPoint() should accept an owner parameter aragonOS/contracts/ens/ENSSubdomainRegistrar.sol : Mirror createName() 's interface and increase flexibility Nomenclature: aragonOS/contracts/common/EVMCallScript.sol : EVMCallScriptRunner.LogScriptCall event should be named ScriptCall to adhere to the same pattern as all other events (no Log prefix) aragonOS/contracts/kernel/IKernel.sol : Function names and arguments have a naming mismatch; names are called in terms of permission s whereas arguments are always called in terms of role s ChangePermissionManager event could have its manager parameter renamed as newManager for clarity Comments: aragonOS/contracts/apps/AppProxy.sol and aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol : Fallback function: a note indicating that no return statement is needed for delegatedFwd() to return a bytes32 value would be nice (it is puzzling at first glance why the comments say they return data but the function signatures and bodies don't contain return s; it's additionally puzzling because Solidity disallows fallbacks from returning). Also, I believe it's more than just a bytes32 being returned now (post Byzantium); it should be the entire return? aragonOS/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol : Would be nice to have an @returns comment aragonOS/contracts/common/IForwarder.sol : Would be nice to have some comments documenting the interface aragonOS/contracts/common/Initializable.sol : initialized() : Function to be called by subclassed contract to signal it has been initialized. may better reflect the intended usage of initialized() aragonOS/contracts/kernel/IKernel.sol : Might be nice to move some of the comments detailing functions from aragonOS/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol to the interface contract aragonOS/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol : It may be useful to have a detailed example for each complex mapping, e.g: mapping (address = mapping (address = mapping (bytes32 = bool))) permissions could have (entity = (app = (role = hasPermission))) Remove all instances of parent and replace with manager setAppCode() : suggest changing @dev comment to @dev Changes implementation address for all installed apps with \\ _appId`. This must be called for `_appId` before any apps of `_appId` work properly. solc build warning: aragonOS/contracts/apm/Repo.sol:78:5: Warning: Function state mutability can be restricted to pure function isValidBump(uint16[3] _oldVersion, uint16[3] _newVersion) public view returns (bool) { (All other build warnings are either from 3rd party or test contracts, and of low severity) Unused library code: aragonOS/contracts/lib/zeppelin/math/Math.sol Check and update library contracts for latest versions (e.g. Zeppelin, MiniMe) if any bug fixes have been introduced In general, it may be a good idea to introduce ETH / ERC20 escape hatches for non-Vault contracts (e.g. see Escapable , or an even simpler contract that just exposes a function allowing owner to withdraw any ETH or ERC20 token owned by the contract ) Alternatively, contracts could revert in the fallback function and ERC223/677 callbacks, but ERC20 tokens could still be locked up aragon-apps Issues Low-Severity General Given that most storage arrays in the apps are never iterated, they could be implemented with mapping (bytes32 = ...) s instead, where the key is keccak256(' type ', currentNumOfType) . The main advantage of this is being able to avoid any index manipulation targeted for humans (i.e. forcing some arrays to start at 1 because 0 doesn't make intuitive sense). Also, a pseudorandom bytes32 value arguably makes more sense as an identifier than an incrementing uint . Clients could listen to the logs (or rebuild the hashes, if currentNumOfType is known) to build their UIs. Finance aragon-apps/apps/finance/contracts/Finance.sol : Should add clarifications as to whether a token must be added to the budget before being allowed to create payments l204 has a comment stating this to be the case, but the associated require() does not actually complete this check Comments may be beneficial for mappings (e.g. token = budget for budgets ) tokenStatement should be renamed tokenStatements Consider increasing the minimum periodDuration to be greater than one second Extremely small periodDurations can cause the app to be onerous to maintain Deposit logic may benefit from being abstracted into internal _deposit() and _depositFrom() methods Improve DRYness when the combo of _recordIncomingTransaction() and token.transfer() or token.transferFrom() are used newPayment() acts differently for one-time, immediate payments than repeating payments when the payment fails One time payments cause a revert if they cannot be immediately executed while repeating payments will log a PaymentFailure event. It may be beneficial for both cases to match so as to avoid unexpected behaviour for users. One way of accomplishing this would be to cache a one-time payment if it cannot be immediately executed. setBudget() should check that _amount is greater than or equal to the current period's expenses Changing a budget to be smaller than the current period's expenses will likely be confusing for clients and should be avoided Remove payment date check from executePayment() and receiverExecutePayment() require(nextPaymentTime(_paymentId) = getTimestamp()) is already checked in _executePayment() view getters can be made external nextPaymentTime() (l402): payment should be a storage variable nextPaymentTime() 's casting from uint256 to uint64 (l410) should have an associated require(nextPayment = MAX_UINT64) getTimestamp() should return uint64 to conform with other dates _canMakePayment() should be view TokenManager aragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts/TokenManager.sol : transferable and logHolders could be grouped together to save some storage assignVested() could be renamed to assignVesting() to clarify that it creates a vesting for an entity rather than assigning already vested tokens to an entity allHolders() and spendableBalanceOf() could be made external isBalanceIncreaseAllowed() should use .add() : return token.balanceOf(_receiver).add(_inc) = maxAccountTokens transferableBalance() 's _time parameter should be of uint64 for consistency with other dates calculateNonVestedTokens() should sanitize its time inputs: require(start = cliff cliff = vesting) calculateNonVestedTokens() 's vestedTokens calculation could be simplified to uint256 vestedToken = tokens.mul((time - start) / (vesting - start)) (assuming sanity checks above were performed) _assign() should also call _logHolderIfNeeded(_receiver) Voting aragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts/Voting.sol : Add veto role: give an entity the ability to decide a vote unianimously Example use case: give certain entities (e.g. President) extra power to decide votes more quickly (allows them to have more power without being assigned other permissions). Example use case: in a stalemate due to not reaching minAcceptQuorumPct , a DAO may want to restart a vote with a lower minAcceptQuorumPct . At that point, the previous vote could be vetoed to be unsuccessful to allow a new vote to start right away, rather than having to wait for it to expire. Allow minAcceptQuorumPct to be provided when creating a new vote The main utility I could gather from allowing this parameter to be modified was that a DAO may choose different levels of importance for different votes (of the same type, i.e. time and required support), where size of quorum is a proxy for importance. However, given the current implementation, it would require multiple steps to change the minAcceptQuorumPct for a single vote (you'd have to change it, create a vote, and then change it back). Implementing this could be done via an overload, storing the quorum percentage given on initialization as the default percentage. forward() should always use the default percentage. In struct Vote , startDate and executed could be grouped together to save some storage struct Vote 's totalVoters could be renamed to totalPossible to avoid confusion over whether it holds the total number of individual voters or total possible votes canExecute() should use .add() (l153): uint256 totalVotes = vote.yea.add(vote.nay) view getters can be made external _isVoteOpen() should cast up rather than down: return now uint256(vote.startDate).add(uint256(voteTime)) !vote.executed; _isValuePct() could be renamed to _isAtLeastPct() for clarity _isValuePct() should use .mul() (l268): uint256 m = _total.mul(_pct) Tools Solgraph Only EtherToken.sol was flagged for having an untrusted transfer() to another contract (see Oyente for a note on this). Noted that solgraph is non-exhaustive and only assumes contracts to be untrusted if they send funds to an external contract. However, it can be useful for quickly telling which contracts are likely to be more complicated, as well as helping visualize the interdependencies between functions in a contract. Test details Created function graphs via: # Globstar and multiple variable substitutions may have to be turned on in your shell # aragonOS for contract in contracts/**/*.sol; do echo 'Graphing' ${contract} mkdir -p solgraph/${${contract#contracts/}%/*} solgraph ${contract} | dot -Tpng solgraph/${${contract#contracts/}%\\.sol}.png done # aragon-apps mkdir -p solgraph/aragon-apps for contract in aragon-apps/apps/**/contracts/*.sol; do echo 'Graphing' ${contract} solgraph ${contract} | dot -Tpng solgraph/aragon-apps/${${contract#*/contracts/}%\\.sol}.png done Note : currently requires my fork of solgraph (install via npm install -g git+https://github.com/sohkai/solgraph.git ) Oyente In non-lib files, Oyente only reported a single potential error: EtherToken.sol (transaction order dependency) On analysis, this does not seem to be a real problem. The only time re-ordering would have an effect would be if someone tried to take out more than their total balance in multiple (different value) transactions. The total amount withdrawn would be indeterminate but no contract invariants would be invalidated. Re-entrancy shouldn't be a problem either, as all state changes happen before the call to transfer() . Oyente also reported a potential re-entrancy error in MiniMeToken.sol On analysis, this does not seem to be a real problem Note that Oyente wasn't able to parse interface files, but even if it could, it wouldn't find any issues in them Test details Ran tests using supplied docker image: # Globstar may have to be turned on in docker's bash docker pull luongnguyen/oyente docker run -i -d -t luongnguyen/oyente # Find name of container via docker ps docker cp ./contracts name :/contracts docker attach name # Upgrade solc to 0.4.19 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum sudo apt-get update sudo install solc=1:0.4.19-0ubuntu1~zesty # aragonOS (docker) for contract in /aragonOS/**/*.sol; do echo 'Testing' ${contract} dirname=${contract%/*} dirname=/aragonOS/oyente/${dirname#/aragonOS/} mkdir -p ${dirname} filename=${contract%\\.sol} filename=/aragonOS/oyente/${filename#/aragonOS/} python oyente.py -s ${contract} 2 ${filename} done # aragon-apps will be tested after updating to use aragonOS 3.0.0 docker cp name :/aragonOS/oyente oyente/results/ Note : tests were run after being compiled with solc=0.4.19 (contracts were modified to all allow ^0.4.18 compiler versions).

The main advantage of this is being able to avoid any index manipulation targeted for humans (i.e. forcing some arrays to start at 1 because 0 doesn't make intuitive sense). Also, a pseudorandom bytes32 value arguably makes more sense as an identifier than an incrementing uint . Clients could listen to the logs (or rebuild the hashes, if currentNumOfType is known) to build their UIs.

It may be beneficial for both cases to match so as to avoid unexpected behaviour for users. One way of accomplishing this would be to cache a one-time payment if it cannot be immediately executed. setBudget() should check that _amount is greater than or equal to the current period's expenses Changing a budget to be smaller than the current period's expenses will likely be confusing for clients and should be avoided Remove payment date check from executePayment() and receiverExecutePayment() require(nextPaymentTime(_paymentId) = getTimestamp()) is already checked in _executePayment() view getters can be made external nextPaymentTime() (l402): payment should be a storage variable nextPaymentTime() 's casting from uint256 to uint64 (l410) should have an associated require(nextPayment = MAX_UINT64) getTimestamp() should return uint64 to conform with other dates _canMakePayment() should be view TokenManager aragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts/TokenManager.sol : transferable and logHolders could be grouped together to save some storage assignVested() could be renamed to assignVesting() to clarify that it creates a vesting for an entity rather than assigning already vested tokens to an entity allHolders() and spendableBalanceOf() could be made external isBalanceIncreaseAllowed() should use .add() : return token.balanceOf(_receiver).add(_inc) = maxAccountTokens transferableBalance() 's _time parameter should be of uint64 for consistency with other dates calculateNonVestedTokens() should sanitize its time inputs: require(start = cliff cliff = vesting) calculateNonVestedTokens() 's vestedTokens calculation could be simplified to uint256 vestedToken = tokens.mul((time - start) / (vesting - start)) (assuming sanity checks above were performed) _assign() should also call _logHolderIfNeeded(_receiver) Voting aragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts/Voting.sol : Add veto role: give an entity the ability to decide a vote unianimously Example use case: give certain entities (e.g. President) extra power to decide votes more quickly (allows them to have more power without being assigned other permissions). Example use case: in a stalemate due to not reaching minAcceptQuorumPct , a DAO may want to restart a vote with a lower minAcceptQuorumPct . At that point, the previous vote could be vetoed to be unsuccessful to allow a new vote to start right away, rather than having to wait for it to expire. Allow minAcceptQuorumPct to be provided when creating a new vote The main utility I could gather from allowing this parameter to be modified was that a DAO may choose different levels of importance for different votes (of the same type, i.e. time and required support), where size of quorum is a proxy for importance. However, given the current implementation, it would require multiple steps to change the minAcceptQuorumPct for a single vote (you'd have to change it, create a vote, and then change it back). Implementing this could be done via an overload, storing the quorum percentage given on initialization as the default percentage. forward() should always use the default percentage. In struct Vote , startDate and executed could be grouped together to save some storage struct Vote 's totalVoters could be renamed to totalPossible to avoid confusion over whether it holds the total number of individual voters or total possible votes canExecute() should use .add() (l153): uint256 totalVotes = vote.yea.add(vote.nay) view getters can be made external _isVoteOpen() should cast up rather than down: return now uint256(vote.startDate).add(uint256(voteTime)) !vote.executed; _isValuePct() could be renamed to _isAtLeastPct() for clarity _isValuePct() should use .mul() (l268): uint256 m = _total.mul(_pct)","title":"Low-Severity"},{"location":"documentation/audits/audit_internal_sun/#tools","text":"","title":"Tools"},{"location":"documentation/audits/audit_internal_sun/#solgraph","text":"Only EtherToken.sol was flagged for having an untrusted transfer() to another contract (see Oyente for a note on this).

We were very impressed with the quality of the code. It is without question one of the most advanced smart contract systems in the space and makes extensive use of many new functionalities within Solidity and at the EVM level. Especially notable is the secure way to deploy a core controller that adds upgradability, the access control pattern (ACL) and its flexible execution engines. We spent 3 weeks in March reviewing the code and found 1 critical issue, 3 high severity issues, 4 medium severity issues and 27 low severity issues. We also made 39 comments to the code about things that could be improved or at least things that we believe require a clarification or a deeper look. The critical issue, if exploited, could stop all Aragon DApps deployed if it was not corrected. After our deep dive into the code, we discussed the issues with the Aragon team and they worked to fix all the issues throughout April. We reviewed these fixes and can say that the Aragon team has corrected all of the important security issues that we found. The biggest worry we have with this framework is the possible misunderstanding of this framework by the developers that decide to use it to deploy their DApps. We strongly recommend that all Aragon DApp developers, especially those that are early pioneers, review the code, try to understand how it works, and do not treat it as a black box. We recommend that the Aragon core team and community contributors make a special effort to add useful clarifications in the code. Better documentation will greatly contribute to the high level of security that this framework is designed to provide. From the architectural perspective, we believe that this code base is an incredibly well designed first iteration. However, after the first set of DApps are developed on top of this framework, it is likely that more improvements and refactors will need to be done to accommodate the desired usage of the DApp developers.

Introduction 1.1 About this review The primary focus of this audit was to analyze the aragonOS contracts. We focused our efforts on the Solidity contracts located at https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/v3.0.1/contracts (bf434fc6a0720bff091a5d3abfc1190e5ec3f342) For the aragon-apps we started at commit: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/3542fea317c641f801cef6ca365f52fda97c7323 We concluded the audit by reviewing only the changes related to the initially found issues up to https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/be4522b264d2224279fbfe582f424f3c6c8d3c9b and https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/05bf9e858e5234429f13bda22b7db9f79cba2f9e . We assembled a multidisciplinary team to get deep into the project and find as many issues as we could in the three weeks we set aside to review this code. Scope: Solidity Contracts We critically analyzed the aragonOS contracts and aragon-app contracts to understand the system. We ran local test deployments and created proof of concept apps to try out the aragon system first hand. Solidity audits are something our core team is most experienced in. We followed our pattern of searching for bugs and performing a critical review to ensure the code matches the intentions of the developers. Out of Scope: As the name implies, the aragonOS is meant to be a foundation layer for business application built on its ACL and kernel components. The following was not in scope: Actual business applications and real world scenarios. Documentation for business use cases (still underway when this review began) User interface and user experience. Deployment process. Even though the team went deep into solidity, we can not assume there are zero errors in the solidity compiler. 1.2 Disclaimer This document includes opinions and recommendations. All the opinions are our own and independent of the Aragon team. We found issues in the Solidity code and general design of system but that does not mean that we found all the issues. 1.3 Team Introduction Jordi Baylina jordi@baylina.cat @jbaylina Over 30 years experience as a developer, and over two years spent researching Ethereum.

When full, we feel the analysis is complete; when partial, we feel further analysis would be beneficial, and when supplemental we feel that the task is not in the scope of analysis but it has been also reviewed Type Description Depth Standard code review includes the common issues that are usually reviewed in all applications: code readability, specification matching, duplicated code, parameter checking, precondition assertions, code conventions, documentation, testing, code coverage, overflow/underflows, unused variables, bounds checking, etc... Full Ethereum security specifics Specific issues related to Solidity and the Ethereum execution environment, see Appendix A. Full Standards Standards fulfillment Full Standard security review Includes defining assets to be protected and checking STRIDE attacks on the system Partial Application logic Check if code logic matches with the expected behaviour defined in the documentation n/a (Crypto)Economics Checks for (crypto)economic points of failure, and weakness in punish/incentivization systems Supplemental Decentralization Checks for centralized points of failure Supplemental Simulation Simulate the system Supplemental Our findings are presented in the form V0##-XX, R00#-XX, and are specified in the Review Results section of the document, using the following pattern: Description Description of the finding Location Where is located (if applicable) Severity The threats have been classified into five groups (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Comment) depending on the impact and the likelihood of the event. Sometimes it is really complicated to guess the likelihood or the impact of the finding. We use OWASP threat classification. Unknown Likelihood Low Likelihood Medium Likelihood High Likelihood High Impact Medium Medium High Critical Medium impact Medium Low Medium High Low impact Comment Comment Low Medium Unknown Impact Medium Medium Medium Medium Status \u201cFixed\u201d means that the reviewing team considers that the issue has been repaired. \u201cNot fixed\u201d means that the issue is still present. Comments Our thoughts on the issue. The recommendations provided are not based on a detailed and deep analysis of the underlying problem, therefore they should be considered as a reference and not a definitive solution. 2.

Description About https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/evmscript/executors/DelegateScript.sol#L24 There is only one DelegateScript instance globally created in EVMScriptRegistryFactory . This DelegateScript has the public everybody callable method execScript(bytes _script, bytes _input, address[] _blacklist) . If the delegatecall-ed contract method contains a SELFDESTRUCT , the destructed contract will be the EVMScriptRegistryFactory baseDel instance which cannot be redeployed since it's not upgradable. About https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues/250 fix The fix, based on the assumption that a function that SELFDESTRUCTs called from a delegatecall never will return any data ( RETURNDATASIZE is 0 ), can be bypassed by doing an extra delegatecall jump, see the following exploit, based on current test mocks: contract DyingDelegatorHelper { function die() public returns (bool) { selfdestruct(0x0); return true; } } contract DyingDelegator is DelegateScriptTarget { function exec() public returns (bool) { DyingDelegatorHelper helper = new DyingDelegatorHelper(); address(helper).delegatecall(DyingDelegatorHelper(0).die.selector); return true; } } Comments Consider limiting DelegateScript callers to the EVMScriptRunner . 2.2 High Severity Issues [V002-HI] Irrevocable permissions Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol#L121 High os#211 Fixed Description By using require for permissions you can reach a situation where the permission depends on the parameters and you cannot revoke the permission because you don't check the specific parameters. Comments Should remove require permissions. [V003-HI] Function receiveApproval can exploit orgs/users with 0xFFF approval Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol# L157 High apps#83 Fixed. Description Currently, any user can call the receiveApproval function, moving another user\u2019s tokens if they have given a 0xFFF approval to the org. Because this is really a hook called by the token contract, only the token should be able to call receiveApproval . It is up to the token to have the necessary protections. Comments Consider adding a require(msg.sender == _token) . [V004-HI] Possible overflow in voteTime Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ aragon-apps/blob/master/a pps/voting/contracts/Voting .sol#L265 High apps#187 Fixed Description The voteTime parameter is the seconds that a vote will be open for token holders. When checking _isVoteOpen , it is possible that vote.startDate + voteTime will overflow. 2.3 Medium Severity Issues [V005-MD] Cannot easily view permissions Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol Medium os#251 Fixed Description For security and recovery situations a fast way to view permissions is necessary. Imagine a rogue employee starts moving funds. It would be good to be able to quickly see what other permissions that user has. Or if something strange is happening, being able to easily retrieve all permissions is helpful. Comments A getPermissionParams function would be very handy. Given entity, app, and role, tell me the parameters. [V006-MD] AppManager can upgrade a pinned app Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ kernel/Kernel.sol#L62 Medium Not fixed Future improvement: aOS 4.0 Description There are two ways to get the baseCode for an app. Typically they would use AppProxy.getCode() . However if the proxy instance is registered with the kernel, you can fetch the app addr with kernel.getApp() . Thus if you register a AppProxyPinned instance with the kernel, then anywhere kernel.getApp is called to fetch the app address, it can be replaced with a new address by calling kernel.setApp . So the app isn't really pinned because it is replaceable. [V007-MD] CallScript buffer overflows Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ evmscript/executors/CallsScri pt.sol#L41 Medium os#263 Fixed Description Since no bounding checks are performed for _script pointer, you can read data beyond the limit of the length. Comments Check that calldataStart + calldataLength _script.length to prevent buffer overflows. [V008-MD] Can create vote before initialize Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/tree/d9dff36a84ff95 6d21628de0e29423d967404 dc5/apps/voting/contracts/Vot ing.sol Medium apps#188 Fixed Description A newVote can be created and automatically executed without taking a vote if the voting contract has not been initialized. The worry is that this odd feature could be exploited by attackers. Here is an example: A deployer deploys a contract Attacker creates a proposal to send all funds to address X. The quorum for this will be zero. The attacker votes for this proposal using another address so that it can be executed later. But also needs to vote for it in the same block as the vote deadline is also 0. The deployer initializes the contract. and gives it access to move funds from a vault. The attacker executes the vote that they have already passed and takes all the funds. Comments Have a afterInitalize modifier. Or use a factory to deploy. 2.4 Low Severity Issues [V009-LW] Issues if Solidity is upgraded Location Severity Status Example: https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ kernel/Kernel.sol#L11 Low Not Fixed Documentation and tooling issue. Description Even though the likelihood of this event is \u201cvery low\u201d, we consider this issue of medium severity, to give an special attention to it. There are concerns about criteria changes in future solidity versions. The control that developers have on where the variables are stored is quite limited. Dependency on the multi-inheritance order on the definition of the class may variate the way state variables are stored. As an example, in Kernel, If we swap KernelStorage and Initializable it would break compatibility. This can easily happen in user defined apps and errors would be very difficult to detect causing all kinds of problems to those upgraded apps. [V010-LW] Previous repo releases are not fixable Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ apm/Repo.sol#L78 Low os#253 Not Fixed Future improvement for aOS 4.0 Description Concerning semantic version checks with isValidBump in APM Repo contract, if you release the version 3.0.0 after the 2.7.0, you will be not able to release a 2.7.1 patch. Comments May be a good idea if the isValidBump does not check the major version to allow patch fixing of previous ones. [V011-LW] ACL does not always return false when calling faulty ACLOracle Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/cont racts/acl/ACL.sol#L261 Low os#252 Fixed Description When calling the ACL to check params, the evalParam function will always return false except when the ACLOracle is called which will potentially revert . Comments Using an assembly call to the ACLOracle and checking if the call succeeded or failed, will provide consistent handling of the params. May want to limit the gas provided to the ACLOracle as well. [V012-LW] Min period of 1 sec is too short Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol# L119 Low apps#240 Fixed Description Min period of 1 sec for finance purposes makes no sense and it is possible to get into race conditions where a payment can not be made (due to the fact that you can only advance 20 periods per tx). Comments A min period of 1 day should be more than enough. [V013-LW] _reference is lost for a single payment Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol# L220 Low apps#219 Fixed Description For a single payment in Finance app, you lose the _reference param. Comments Consider passing _reference to _makePaymentTransaction so the _reference is logged. [V014-LW] Race condition exists for payment recipients Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol Low Not Fixed No action will be taken. Inherent ethereum flaw. Description If an organization using the Finance app owes more money out to receivers than it has, then receivers may begin racing each other hoping to get to any funds first as soon as they are available using the receiverExecutePayment function. Comments Avoiding these kinds of races can be done by defining and implementing a better policy for payments when there is not enough money. Maybe prioritising older receivers or the ones with more reputation. Or may be allowing only to withdraw a portion of the funds. Any of these solutions may require a large development effort for something that may be complex and not worthy. So keeping the code as is, is probably the best decision at this stage, but users of this contract should be aware of this flaw. [V015-LW] Forward is too permissive Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/to ken-manager/contracts/Toke nManager.sol#L182 Low Not Fixed No action will be taken. Documentation issue. Description There are some great use cases for forwarding evm script functions. But this functionality should not be included as a general default with the TokenManager. It violates the single responsibility principle. It allows a function to return very different outputs. Comments This functionality might be better placed outside the TokenManager in a contract specifically designed for the specific use cases it is intended for. Creating multiple instances of employees or IDs are two examples. [V016-LW] Should not permit anything if no Kernel or ACL is defined Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ apps/AragonApp.sol#L29 Low Not Fixed See: https://github.com/aragon/aragon OS/issues/325 Documentation issue. Description The Kernel and ACL are central to the operation of Aragon apps and so apps should be able to expect that they are defined. If the Kernel or ACL are not defined, then nothing should be allowed. Comments Aragon\u2019s argument about this issue is that an application should be able to run in standalone mode (Without an ACL defined). This seems a little dangerous (but not an issue by itself) since this permits any operation when this variable is set to zero (the initial value). In any case, this should be very well documented in the code and in the usage handbook. [V017-LW] Create permissions granted indefinitely to factories Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ factory/DAOFactory.sol#L51 https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ factory/EVMScriptRegistryFa ctory.sol#L40 Low os#217 Fixed We recommend adding a test for this fix Description If regFactory is provided, then initialRoot is set to this . this is then passed to dao.initialize which will grant the create permissions role to the factory contract. Comments We should revoke the acl.CREATE_PERMISSIONS_ROLE permission in both the dao and evm registry factories. [V018-LW] Potential overflow when setting new period Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol# L130 https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol# L446 Low apps#254 Fixed Description It's possible to overflow when initializing the Finance app. During initialization, the call to _newPeriod could overflow where endTime is set. Comments The setPeriodDuration function should have a max _periodDuration to prevent overflows. [V019-LW] Incorrect percentage check Location Severity PR Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/tree/d9dff36a84ff95 6d21628de0e29423d967404 dc5/apps/voting/contracts/Vot ing.sol#L64 Low apps#99 Fixed Description Percentage integers can have a value of 1 so should not check 1 . Comments Should be 0 instead of 1 . [V020-LW] Solidity forced to 0.4.18 Location Severity Status All contracts. Low Not Fixed No action. Will upgrade solc if necessary in future deployments / upgrades Description If there is an error in solidity version 0.4.18 and an upgrade is needed, this will need to be updated. It\u2019s not clear for aragonOS users (developers) what they need to do in this case. [V021-LW] Potential infinite loop in ACL logic Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol#L285 Low Not Fixed Future improvement: aOS 4.0 Description Potential infinite loop in ACL logic. Comments Ensure that condition is always advancing to prevent getting into an infinite loop. [V022-LW] encodeParams can conflict w/ the reserved param ids (200+) Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol#L207 Low Not Fixed Future improvement: aOS 4.0 Description In ACL._saveParams suggest limit _encodeParams to 50-100 params. This will help prevent consuming too much gas as well as prevent conflicts with the reserved param ids. [V023-LW] No way to revoke all granted permissions for a role Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol Low Not Fixed Future improvement: aOS 4.0 Description There is no easy way to revokeAll grantedPermissions for an app, role combination. This functionality is usually needed in emergency situations. Comments Easy fix is to have an \"era\" for each roleHash . To revokeAll for a roleHash , just increase the era. [V024-LW] No way to restrict deposits in Finance app Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/tree/d9dff36a84ff95 6d21628de0e29423d967404 dc5/apps/finance/contracts/Fi nance.sol#L140 Low Not Fixed Fix is UI level Description In Finance app there is a possible attack to clutter transactions by sending one wei transactions. The problem here is that you could overflow the UI. Comments Should have a deposit role in Finance app to restrict the 3 deposit functions. [V025-LW] tokenFallback can clutter with gas payment Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/tree/d9dff36a84ff95 6d21628de0e29423d967404 dc5/apps/finance/contracts/Fi nance.sol#L182 Low Not Fixed Fix is UI level Description In the Finance app, the tokenFallback can log an event with only gas payment, leading to cluttering of the UI. Comments Prevent the event from being triggered if msg.value == 0 . [V026-LW] Finance app doesn\u2019t check if vault etherToken are valid Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/tree/d9dff36a84ff95 6d21628de0e29423d967404 dc5/apps/finance/contracts/Fi nance.sol#L116 Low apps#256 Fixed Description Finance app doesn\u2019t check if vault and etherToken are valid. Comments The Finance app\u2019s initialize function should check vault and etherToken != 0 . Alternatively, it may be better to use kernel for vault and etherToken . In addition code has been changed since time of initial audit to no longer rely on an ethertoken as the vault has been generalized. The generalized changes to the vault have not been audited. [V027-LW] No easy way to debug evalParams Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/e271a2a2e3d452 8fe00d79b5dbbc7aefeea90b2 7/contracts/acl/ACL.sol#L228 Low os#251 Fixed Description No easy way to debug evalParams .

[V029-LW] ACL is based off of user input Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/e271a2a2e3d45 28fe00d79b5dbbc7aefeea90 b27/contracts/acl/ACL.sol#L2 85 Low Not Fixed User documentation Description ACL can make buggy permissions that can bypass the permission. Comments ACL is based off of user input and test coverage does not extend to modifiers. Analyze the following example: create a parameter with LOGIC_OP_PARAM_ID = param.id . But with _param.op not equal to Op.IF_ELSE , Op.Not , Op.OR , Op.And,Op.XOR will result in r2 being returned when evalLogic gets called from evalParam bypassing the param.id check. This is a good one for the underhanded aragonOS competition. [V030-LW] TokenManager can be given a non-transferrable token Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/tree/d9dff36a84ff95 6d21628de0e29423d967404 dc5/apps/token-manager/con tracts/TokenManager.sol#L59 Low apps#280 Fixed Description The TokenManager app is designed to handle transferability of the token.

Comments Thus the function should not be marked as view . [V034-LW] Can't call send or transfer on aragon app Location Severity Issue Status Anywhere a delegate proxy is used Comment OS#281 Fixed (with new functionality that may need deeper review) Comment Send or transfer only permits 2300 gas but delegate proxy requires 10000 + execution costs. This means that you can not use the re-entrancy safe transfer and send methods provided by solidity to call an AragonApp. You would need to manually limit the gas with vault.call.gas(16000).value(msg.value)() . This issue, has been fixed recently in https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/281 . Please note that this PR also includes the token recoverability functionality. The way it has been solved is by always accepting send and transfer calls with ETH and then creating a mechanism for token recovery including ETH. This mechanism may complicate the contracts aimed to receive ETH by default, and any other application that will have to define a token. Aragon App developers must be very aware of this mechanism. This mechanism may also bring some issues with clients using the eth_estimateGas function. Please, also note that this functionality was not part of this code review and has not been fully reviewed. 3. Recommendations 3.1 Architecture Comments [V035-CM] Failsafe mode Location Severity Status n/a Comment Not Fixed Future improvement: aOS 4.0 Comment Currently, if a fatal error occurs while deploying a new ACL or a faulty ACL is deployed, the kernel can become inoperative without the possibility of redeploying the ACL app. [V036-CM] Move ACL param logic to oracle Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol#285 Comment Not Fixed Comment The ACL param logic adds a lot of complexity to the ACL. In order to simplify such a critical component, consider moving the param logic to an ACLOracle. This way, the complexity is \u201copt in\u201d and a decision can be made on a DAO by DAO basis if they would like to include the ACL language or use a custom ACLOracle to handle permissions. [V037-CM] Isolate apps that are granted powerful permissions Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol Comment Not Fixed Future improvement: aOS 4.0 Comment Related to V037-CM, there are a few permissions that are critical to the operation of the DAO. If these permissions fall into the wrong hands, they can break the entire DAO and any apps that share an ACL/Kernel. Sometimes these permissions are given to Apps within the DAO. A bug in 1 of these \u201cprivileged apps\u201d can affect the entire DAO. Consider deploying Apps that are granted powerful permissions with a separate kernel, when possible, in order to provide some sandboxing. [V038-CM] Cache variables are in AragonApp\u2019s storage Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ evmscript/executors/DeployD elegateScript.sol#L11 Comment Fixed Comment DeployDelegateScript contains a storage variable cache calculated from indexed storage slot 0 . Contracts implementing EVMScriptRunner (AragonApp) make a delegatecall to the scriptExecutor. When this scriptExecutor is the DeployDelegateScript executor this cache variable will potentially conflict with the calling contracts storage in slot 0 , thus potentially leading to storage corruption and unexpected state. With the current AragonStorage layout, there is no conflict because cache is a mapping and thus stored in slot keccak256(\u20180\u2019 . index) and the first storage variable in AragonStorage is IKernel and stored in slot 0 .

Security checks Assets Considered as threat targets, smart contracts and user interface application logic should enforce using the underlying Ethereum technology to guarantee the self-protection and non-by-passability of the access controls for the following assets: ETH Stored/transferred ether asserts TOKEN Stored/transferred token asserts (like ERC20) ACL Deployed permissions Upgradability Components (smartcontracts) upgradeability Core Isolation Applications are not allowed to modify core data App Isolation Applications are not allowed to modify data from other applications, only explicit communication channels can be used to share information between them. Threat Agents We use the following categories to understand who might attack the smart contracts: Accidental Discovery An ordinary user stumbles across a functional mistake in your application, just using a web browser, and gains access to privileged information or functionality. Privileged account mistake A mistake (e.g. client library failures or fat finger errors) performed from an account that has special privileges on the smart contracts. Automated Malware Programs or scripts, which are searching for known vulnerabilities, and then report them back to a central collection site. The Curious Attacker A security researcher or ordinary user, who notices something wrong with the application, and decides to pursue further. Script Kiddies Common renegades, seeking to compromise or deface applications for collateral gain, notoriety, or a political agenda. The Motivated Attacker Potentially, a disgruntled staff member with inside knowledge or a paid professional attacker. Whales Big economic agents abusing blockchain economic models for financial gain. Miners Miners abusing blockchain protocols for financial gain. Big Organizations Highly trained professionals and criminals cracking or abusing blockchain smart contracts and protocols for financial gain, reputation destruction or geopolitical cyber warfare. Operational Environment We use the following operative scenarios when analyzing threats: Normal operation Ethereum ecosystem is stable Network congestion High amount of pending transactions makes a Ethereum network congestion High volatility ETH/$ price is having a high volatility Fork A contentious fork of Ethereum that produces 2 seperate networks. Unexpected fatal bug / global settlement An unexpected critical bug is found on the smart contracts Subsystems failure Auxiliary subsystems (e.g. oracles) fails Operators failure Smart contract operators fails or delays the execution Whale attacks Economic whales gone wild Common Security Problems Checklist Trivial Errors Shadowing Misnamed variables Missing require guards Variable confusion String Literals/Magic Numbers Standards Conformity Tx.origin use Erroneous Constant State Functions Race Conditions Re-entrancy Recursion External/Cross Contract Calls Front Running Miner specific attacks Blocktime Attacks Transaction Reordering Attacks DoS Revert Block Gas Limit/Dynamic Loops Integer Overflow Underflow Template Misuse/Plugin Trust Issues Dynamic Array Memory Manipulation ABI Length Encoding Exploit Forced Balance Manipulation Malicious Higher Order Bit Parameters Economic Attacks Unsolved Solidity Bugs Bad function access control Replay/nonce attacks Library initialization Post-deployment ACLs","title":"Audit Report 01 by White Hat Group"},{"location":"documentation/audits/audit_whg01_report/#aragonos-code-review","text":"Download original PDF Jordi Baylina jordi@baylina.cat Barry Whitehat barrywhitehat@protonmail.com Adri\u00e0 Massanet adria@codecontext.io Arthur Lunn Quazia@giveth.io Oswald Jones oz@giveth.io RJ Ewing perissology@protonmail.com Griff Green griff@giveth.io Release V1.4 / 2018-06-22","title":"aragonOS Code Review"},{"location":"documentation/audits/audit_whg01_report/#executive-summary","text":"In February, Aragon asked us to do a code review for the aragonOS framework as well as the Finance, Vault, Voting and Token Manager applications. We were very impressed with the quality of the code. It is without question one of the most advanced smart contract systems in the space and makes extensive use of many new functionalities within Solidity and at the EVM level. Especially notable is the secure way to deploy a core controller that adds upgradability, the access control pattern (ACL) and its flexible execution engines. We spent 3 weeks in March reviewing the code and found 1 critical issue, 3 high severity issues, 4 medium severity issues and 27 low severity issues. We also made 39 comments to the code about things that could be improved or at least things that we believe require a clarification or a deeper look. The critical issue, if exploited, could stop all Aragon DApps deployed if it was not corrected. After our deep dive into the code, we discussed the issues with the Aragon team and they worked to fix all the issues throughout April. We reviewed these fixes and can say that the Aragon team has corrected all of the important security issues that we found. The biggest worry we have with this framework is the possible misunderstanding of this framework by the developers that decide to use it to deploy their DApps. We strongly recommend that all Aragon DApp developers, especially those that are early pioneers, review the code, try to understand how it works, and do not treat it as a black box. We recommend that the Aragon core team and community contributors make a special effort to add useful clarifications in the code. Better documentation will greatly contribute to the high level of security that this framework is designed to provide. From the architectural perspective, we believe that this code base is an incredibly well designed first iteration. However, after the first set of DApps are developed on top of this framework, it is likely that more improvements and refactors will need to be done to accommodate the desired usage of the DApp developers.","title":"Executive Summary"},{"location":"documentation/audits/audit_whg01_report/#table-of-contents","text":"Executive Summary Table of Contents 1.

We assembled a multidisciplinary team to get deep into the project and find as many issues as we could in the three weeks we set aside to review this code. Scope: Solidity Contracts We critically analyzed the aragonOS contracts and aragon-app contracts to understand the system. We ran local test deployments and created proof of concept apps to try out the aragon system first hand. Solidity audits are something our core team is most experienced in. We followed our pattern of searching for bugs and performing a critical review to ensure the code matches the intentions of the developers. Out of Scope: As the name implies, the aragonOS is meant to be a foundation layer for business application built on its ACL and kernel components. The following was not in scope: Actual business applications and real world scenarios. Documentation for business use cases (still underway when this review began) User interface and user experience.

Imagine a rogue employee starts moving funds. It would be good to be able to quickly see what other permissions that user has. Or if something strange is happening, being able to easily retrieve all permissions is helpful. Comments A getPermissionParams function would be very handy.

However if the proxy instance is registered with the kernel, you can fetch the app addr with kernel.getApp() . Thus if you register a AppProxyPinned instance with the kernel, then anywhere kernel.getApp is called to fetch the app address, it can be replaced with a new address by calling kernel.setApp .

Description Even though the likelihood of this event is \u201cvery low\u201d, we consider this issue of medium severity, to give an special attention to it. There are concerns about criteria changes in future solidity versions. The control that developers have on where the variables are stored is quite limited. Dependency on the multi-inheritance order on the definition of the class may variate the way state variables are stored. As an example, in Kernel, If we swap KernelStorage and Initializable it would break compatibility.

Inherent ethereum flaw. Description If an organization using the Finance app owes more money out to receivers than it has, then receivers may begin racing each other hoping to get to any funds first as soon as they are available using the receiverExecutePayment function. Comments Avoiding these kinds of races can be done by defining and implementing a better policy for payments when there is not enough money. Maybe prioritising older receivers or the ones with more reputation. Or may be allowing only to withdraw a portion of the funds. Any of these solutions may require a large development effort for something that may be complex and not worthy. So keeping the code as is, is probably the best decision at this stage, but users of this contract should be aware of this flaw.

Documentation issue. Description There are some great use cases for forwarding evm script functions. But this functionality should not be included as a general default with the TokenManager. It violates the single responsibility principle. It allows a function to return very different outputs. Comments This functionality might be better placed outside the TokenManager in a contract specifically designed for the specific use cases it is intended for. Creating multiple instances of employees or IDs are two examples. [V016-LW] Should not permit anything if no Kernel or ACL is defined Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ apps/AragonApp.sol#L29 Low Not Fixed See: https://github.com/aragon/aragon OS/issues/325 Documentation issue. Description The Kernel and ACL are central to the operation of Aragon apps and so apps should be able to expect that they are defined. If the Kernel or ACL are not defined, then nothing should be allowed. Comments Aragon\u2019s argument about this issue is that an application should be able to run in standalone mode (Without an ACL defined). This seems a little dangerous (but not an issue by itself) since this permits any operation when this variable is set to zero (the initial value). In any case, this should be very well documented in the code and in the usage handbook.

Comments The Finance app\u2019s initialize function should check vault and etherToken != 0 . Alternatively, it may be better to use kernel for vault and etherToken . In addition code has been changed since time of initial audit to no longer rely on an ethertoken as the vault has been generalized. The generalized changes to the vault have not been audited.

Comments ACL is based off of user input and test coverage does not extend to modifiers. Analyze the following example: create a parameter with LOGIC_OP_PARAM_ID = param.id . But with _param.op not equal to Op.IF_ELSE , Op.Not , Op.OR , Op.And,Op.XOR will result in r2 being returned when evalLogic gets called from evalParam bypassing the param.id check. This is a good one for the underhanded aragonOS competition.

Comments Thus the function should not be marked as view . [V034-LW] Can't call send or transfer on aragon app Location Severity Issue Status Anywhere a delegate proxy is used Comment OS#281 Fixed (with new functionality that may need deeper review) Comment Send or transfer only permits 2300 gas but delegate proxy requires 10000 + execution costs. This means that you can not use the re-entrancy safe transfer and send methods provided by solidity to call an AragonApp. You would need to manually limit the gas with vault.call.gas(16000).value(msg.value)() . This issue, has been fixed recently in https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/281 . Please note that this PR also includes the token recoverability functionality. The way it has been solved is by always accepting send and transfer calls with ETH and then creating a mechanism for token recovery including ETH. This mechanism may complicate the contracts aimed to receive ETH by default, and any other application that will have to define a token. Aragon App developers must be very aware of this mechanism. This mechanism may also bring some issues with clients using the eth_estimateGas function. Please, also note that this functionality was not part of this code review and has not been fully reviewed.","title":"2.4 Low Severity Issues"},{"location":"documentation/audits/audit_whg01_report/#3-recommendations","text":"","title":"3.

In order to simplify such a critical component, consider moving the param logic to an ACLOracle. This way, the complexity is \u201copt in\u201d and a decision can be made on a DAO by DAO basis if they would like to include the ACL language or use a custom ACLOracle to handle permissions.

If these permissions fall into the wrong hands, they can break the entire DAO and any apps that share an ACL/Kernel. Sometimes these permissions are given to Apps within the DAO. A bug in 1 of these \u201cprivileged apps\u201d can affect the entire DAO.

Contracts implementing EVMScriptRunner (AragonApp) make a delegatecall to the scriptExecutor. When this scriptExecutor is the DeployDelegateScript executor this cache variable will potentially conflict with the calling contracts storage in slot 0 , thus potentially leading to storage corruption and unexpected state. With the current AragonStorage layout, there is no conflict because cache is a mapping and thus stored in slot keccak256(\u20180\u2019 . index) and the first storage variable in AragonStorage is IKernel and stored in slot 0 .

Third parties and central authorities both inside and outside of communities have persistently tried to force their way into the relationships between members of communities. Banks, charismatic leaders, governments\u2026 all have made enticing offers and promises of security to protect the community\u2019s interests. And all have at one time or another broken these promises and violated trust. With the advent of bitcoin we were given a way to disintermediate trusted third parties and eliminate the need for central control of digital money. Now with platforms like ethereum we are seeing the rise of a new kind of organization free of centralized control: the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO for short. Communities used to have to trust a bank to protect their shared assets, leaders to govern those assets, and governments to resolve disputes and enforce judgments. DAOs now make it possible for a community to have direct control of their shared assets using smart contracts enforced by a decentralized network of computers. No central authorities required. Let\u2019s look at how this works in practice. First, a member of the community will create a DAO representing the community. They will use an app to easily translate the governance rules of the community into computer code and deploy the code onto a smart contract network like ethereum. Next, the creator of the DAO will add the members of their community to the DAO. Each member now holds a token (or tokens) representing their stake in the community. With power in the organization now held in the hands of the community members, the shared assets of the community can be transferred to the DAO and governed by the rules set by the community. Whenever the assets of the community need to be transferred, for example to pay employees or fund a community project, community members can use their tokens to vote directly to approve or decline the transfer and the outcome of the vote is executed exactly as the rules of the DAO specify. If the community chooses to delegate their power to a smaller group of administrators, they can vote to upgrade the governance rules of their DAO and give the admins the limited power they need to carry out day to day activities on behalf of community members. Then if the community decides to withdraw power from the admins for any reason, they can vote again to withdraw that power. The members are always in full control of their community. If there is a dispute between the members of a DAO or between the DAO and outside individuals or organizations, smart contracts can once again be used to resolve the disputes and execute judgment. An arbitration clause can be added to each contract that enables all parties to the contract to create a dispute that is resolved by an agreed upon arbitrator or decentralized court. And collateral can be used to limit losses by injured parties to a dispute. To some this might sound like science fiction. And to some degree, today it still is. At Aragon we are working to make this sci-fi vision a reality. We want to empower communities to take control of their destiny and break free of central authorities. And we want to provide a safe mechanism for resolving disputes outside the inflexible legal systems run by monopoly jurisdictions in the physical world. A golden age of decentralized organizations and voluntary communities is upon us. With the right tools, an appetite for experimentation, and a culture that believes in the virtues of individual liberty and community autonomy, we can ensure that this golden age lasts long into the future, opening up new opportunities for collaboration and exchange on a global scale.","title":"Freecoast festival 2018"},{"location":"jobs/","text":"Job Openings Aragon is an open source, decentralized, project fighting for the freedom to organize.

Personal thoughts: https://twitter.com/izqui9/status/966338031719415809 Leading up to ETHDenver we did a ton of work on documentation to get it to a point where people could use aragonOS and our tooling to build apps on top of Aragon. People were able to do so, but documentation will require some more work during the following months.

Although a lot of people readily dismiss altcoins these days, there are some interesting projects out there. The Aragon project is currently working on AragonOS, which introduces some major changes to smart contracts as we know them today. More specifically, smart contracts\u2019 underlying architecture is in dire need of some upgrades. Introducing more flexibility and making it easier to extend the functionality of these contracts is well worth looking into. Venturebeat No CEO needed: These blockchain platforms will let \u2018the crowd\u2019 run startups Back in May, I wrote about the concept of DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations capable of running themselves thanks to blockchain technology \u2014 no CEO or C-Suite needed. At the time I was writing, there were a few people in the blockchain community testing out the idea but no strong efforts underway. That was six months ago. As anyone in the crypto space will tell you, six months is a really long time. Today, a market for DAO platforms is emerging, complete with teams, funding, development, and initial implementations. 12 changes that could shake up the blockchain world in 2018 If there is one thing I have learned in the last two years in the cryptocurrency world, it\u2019s that things change so quickly in this sector, it can humble anybody. Anyone who says he knows what he is talking about, doesn\u2019t! Still, it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day, so what the heck? I\u2019ll put my neck out there with 12 predictions for 2018: ETHNews Aragon ICO Makes Millions In Minutes In the time it might take to warm up a small meal, Aragon\u2019s ICO made the company $25 million in Ether. On May 17, 2017, disintermediation platform Aragon announced it closed an ICO in less than 15 minutes, raking in $25,000,000 in Ether (ETH) from 2,403 investors in exchange for ANT tokens, and making it the fourth highest crowdsale ever. ValueWalk Aragon Introduces Grants Program To Further Ecosystem Development Aragon, the governance platform for decentralized organizations, has decided to support its community by introducing \u2018 Aragon Nest \u2019, a unique grants program to accelerate ecosystem development. This is a very exciting initiative and shows the importance of community involvement to the blockchain movement, some experts argue. See more from the company press release below. Introducing the \u2018Aragon Nest\u2019 Grants Program How The Token Model Is Changing Coding For The Better For a long time free and open source software was a niche seen by many as a threat to major software developers and large corporations who wished to enforce stricter intellectual property rights. Although patents and intellectual property rights were originally designed to protect the rights of the creators, in coding this is often enforced to the detriment of the community at large. However, during the last decades, open source models were gaining popularity and had a loyal following particularly among Linux enthusiasts. Open source offers great benefits in the areas of cost, flexibility, freedom, security, and accountability. You can see how the code is developed, what it does, and why. Unlike closed proprietary software, code can be altered and extended by any developer. CCN Ethereum-Based Aragon Raises $25 Million Under 15 Minutes in Record ICO Ethereum-based enterprise management platform Aragon has announced details of its Wednesday ICO token sale, raising a mammoth $25 million. The token sale saw participation from 2,403 buyers around the world and lasted under 15 minutes to raise the figure for a token sale that was originally set to run until June 14, 2017. Ethereum-Based Aragon Partners ShapeShift for Upcoming Token Sale Ethereum-based distributed network platform Aragon has announced a partnership with leading global exchange ShapeShift in advance of their upcoming token sale. Set to launch May 17th, Aragon counts ICONOMI and CoinFund among its pre-sale buyers. Thanks to the partnership with ShapeShift, users will be able to purchase Aragon Network Tokens (ANT) using the variety of tokens on the ShapeShift platform such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Cointelegraph Why Aragon Co-Founder Sees Ethereum Price Surpassing $1,000 Earlier this month, Aragon co-founder Luis Cuende revealed that he sees the price of Ethereum, which remains at around $261, hitting $1,000 in the long run. In an interview with Sindre Hopland, the media producer at Itnig, Cuende explained that the Ethereum market along with the ICO industry is growing at an exponential rate. Both large-scale and small companies are actively investing in the efficiency of Ethereum network in automating operations with the utilization of smart contracts. Biggest-Ever ICO Jackpot Netted By Ethereum-Based Aragon Despite Bad Actor Ethereum-based business management platform Aragon has raised the largest amount ever in an ICO - almost $25 mln in 15 minutes. The token sale began at 19:30 GMT on Wednesday, but had already sold out minutes later, with investors contributing a total of 275,000 ETH worth around $24.75 mln. Bankless Times Ethereum cofounder Alisie joins Aragon advisory board Decentralized company management platform Aragon announced this week that original Ethereum cofounder Mihai Alisie has joined its advisory board.

Audio Interviews Decentralize This! | Ep 12 - Luis Cuende - Realizing The Promise of Decentralized Organizations Hosted by Enigma's Head of Growth Tor Bair, our twelfth episode features Luis Cuende. Luis is the cofounder of Aragon, a platform that allows anyone to create and manage decentralized organizations. He\u2019s an incredible thinker and builder, having published his first book at 18 and having been named to Forbes 30 under 30. Aragon also recently released a new version of their platform on the Ethereum mainnet, which Luis and Tor discuss. On this episode we\u2019ll also talk why Luis got into the blockchain space, the power of decentralized, autonomous organizations, where our current centralized systems are falling short, and the conflicts between regulation and decentralization - and how those have impacted both Luis and Aragon. The Blockchain and Us | Luis Cuende \u2013 How Digital Jurisdictions Help Us Escape 1984 and Take Back Control Luis Cuende speaks about the inspiration for his startup Aragon, raising over $100 million in his ICO, how he plans to create a digital jurisdiction that isn\u2019t bound to the borders of a single country, how governments manipulate citizens, how he explains the need for digital worlds, which narratives inspire people to reclaim their freedom, societal challenges in the Western world, why jobs are a thing of the past, why he thinks governments should try universal basic income, how blockchains could restrict the power of governments, why he thinks borders create racism, how decentralization on blockchains could create value, the evils of social media, how decentralized systems can avoid the path of social media, why George Orwell\u2019s 1984 is real and what helped this happen, why many people have lost hope, why few digital natives understand the vision of decentralization, and many other things.

Introduction Aragon is an application for creating and governing organizations - such as clubs, corporations, nonprofits, and open source projects - on Ethereum -compatible blockchain networks. Aragon currently supports creating organizations on the main Ethereum network (\u201cmainnet\u201d) and the Rinkeby test network (\u201ctestnet\u201d). Note You can find more information about the Aragon project, decentralized organizations, governance, and other related topics in the Aragon wiki . 0.1 Anatomy of an Aragon organization An Aragon organization is made up of software programs known as \u201csmart contracts\u201d. While traditional legal contracts are ultimately enforced by coercion and the ability to physically seize assets in case one party to the contract does not fulfill their obligations, smart contracts are enforced by computers that ensure the contract is executed exactly as it is programmed. This \u201cself-enforcing\u201d property of smart contracts can reduce the risk involved in certain types of contracts. The smart contract system Aragon is built on is called aragonOS . This system ensures that only authorized accounts and contracts (what Aragon refers to as \u201centities\u201d) have permission to perform specific actions in an organization. The same way that a legal contract defines what rights and obligations a party to the contract has, the aragonOS smart contracts define what rights and obligations entities have in an Aragon organization. Each Aragon organization has apps that can be \u201cinstalled\u201d on aragonOS. These apps extend the functionality of the organization and give members new ways of interacting with each other and the organization itself. Some examples of applications that can be added to Aragon organizations are the Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Permissions apps. Anyone can develop their own app, add it to their own organization, and publish it for others to use as well. Note You can find more information about the technical details of how Aragon works, including how to develop your own Aragon app, in the Aragon Developer Portal . 1. Prerequisites In addition to a working laptop or desktop computer with a decent internet connection, you will need the following to start using Aragon: Up-to-date Brave , Chrome / Chromium , Firefox , or Opera web browser. An Ethereum provider such as MetaMask and a compatible Ethereum wallet such as Ledger or Trezor if your Ethereum provider either does not have key management (\"wallet\") functionality built-in or you prefer not to use the built-in wallet functionality. If you are using Aragon on mainnet, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Main Ethereum Network. You will then need to load your wallet with enough ETH to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. ETH can be acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange that lists ETH. As a rough estimate of how much ETH you should start with, multiply 20,000,000 times the current \u201cstandard\u201d gas price times 0.000000001 to find out how much ETH you need. For example, at a current standard gas price of 10 gwei, you should start with 0.2 ETH. If you are using Aragon on testnet, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Rinkeby Test Network. You will then need to load your wallet with test ether for the Ethereum Rinkeby test network. This test ether is used to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. You can try the Rinkeby faucet or post your Ethereum Rinkeby testnet address in the #faucet channel on Aragon Chat to receive test ether for free. Please wait patiently for an Aragon team member to see your message if you post your faucet request in the Aragon Chat. 2. Templates Templates are pre-configured smart contracts for different types of organizations. You can use the templates that are included with Aragon or create your own. Aragon currently includes two templates: Democracy and Multisig. This section will walk you through examples of how you can use these templates as a starting point for your organization. 2.1 Create a new Democracy organization 2.1.1 Navigate to https://app.aragon.org in your web browser Select which network you want to use to create your organization then click \"Create a new organization\". 2.1.2 Select \u201cToken project with Democracy\u201d then click \u201cNext\u201d A \u201cToken project with Democracy\u201d is an organization where the vote cast by a token holder is weighted proportionally to their ownership stake of tokens minted by the organization. For example, if a tokenholder owns 5% of the tokens minted by the organization then their vote will count as 5% of the total votes on a given proposal. 2.1.3 Claim a domain name then click \u201cNext\u201d Aragon uses the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) to assign names to organizations. Note This name currently cannot be changed. 2.1.4 Set the parameters of your Democracy organization then click \u201cNext\u201d Support \u201cSupport\u201d is the number for what percent of the tokens that participated in a vote must approve a proposal for that proposal to pass. For example, if \u201cSupport\u201d is set to 51%, then 51% of tokens that vote on a proposal must approve the proposal for it to pass. Min. Quorum \u201cMin. Quorum\u201d is short for \u201cMinimum Acceptance Quorum. \u201cMin. Quorum\u201d is the number for what percent of the total outstanding supply of tokens must approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. For example, if the Min. Quorum is set to 20%, then 20% of the outstanding token supply must vote to approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. If a vote does not make quorum, then it will fail, even if more tokens voted to approve the proposal than voted against it. For example, if the Min. Quorum is set to 20% and 10% of the outstanding token supply votes against the proposal but only 15% vote in support, then the proposal will fail because it has not reached the Min. Quorum threshold. Vote Duration \u201cVote Duration\u201d is the length of time that the vote will be open for participation. For example, if the Vote Duration is set to 24 H, then tokenholders have 24 hours to participate in the vote. After the 24 hours is over, if the vote has not been approved by a majority of tokenholders and/or does not make quorum, then the vote will automatically fail. If the vote makes quorum and receives approval by a majority of tokenholders by the end of the Vote Duration, then the vote will automatically pass. 2.1.5 Choose token name and symbol then click \u201cNext\u201d Note The token name and symbol currently cannot be changed. 2.1.6 Sign organization creation transactions Now you need to sign two transactions in MetaMask to create your organization. Open MetaMask if the wallet window does not open automatically. After the first transaction is confirmed, the second transaction may show up in MetaMask as a transaction with an \u201cunapproved\u201d label, indicating that it needs to be signed. Click the transaction to open and sign it. Note Be careful not to close your browser window while creating your organization. If your browser window closes after signing the first transaction to create the organization but before the second transaction appears, then it will be difficult to pick up where you left off after you re-open your browser window. We are working on making it easier to recover from browser closures (due to a crash or otherwise) during the organization creation process in general. Please be advised that ETH used to pay gas for the first organization creation transaction will be \"stuck\" until we implement an easy way to recover and send the second and final organization creation transaction. 2.1.7 Click \u201cGet Started\u201d Your new Democracy organization is ready to go! 2.2 Explore the Democracy organization 2.2.1 Home app The Home app welcomes you to your organization and offers you several options for different actions you can take. You can also use the menu on the left-hand side of the screen to view the different apps that are currently installed for your organization. Aragon currently has the Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Permissions apps installed, with an App Center coming soon. 2.2.2 Token Manager app The Token Manager is the app you use to mint new tokens and assign them to yourself or other entities. You can mint new tokens by following these steps: 2.2.2.1 Click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d button Enter the address of the recipient of the tokens and the number of new tokens you want to mint and assign to that address, then click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d. 2.2.2.2 Create vote to assign tokens Even though you are the only tokenholder, the Democracy organization still requires a tokenholder vote for every action. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d to sign the transaction that creates a new vote to assign the new token you want to mint. Note Creating a vote will automatically make your account vote \u201cYes\u201d on the proposal. You can change your vote by opening the vote in the Voting app, clicking the \u201cNo\u201d button, and signing the transaction to change your vote to \u201cNo\u201d. 2.2.2.3 Sign and send transaction to create the \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d vote After clicking \u201cSign Transaction\u201d, a notification will pop-up in MetaMask. Open MetaMask, then sign and send the transaction to create the vote. 2.2.2.4 Check out the newest member of your organization Since you are the only tokenholder, the vote will automatically pass and the token will automatically be assigned to the entity you added in 2.2.2.1. A good start to a new Democracy organization! Note If a vote is cast that causes the quorum to be equal to the support required (e.g. 60% support with 60% quorum) then the vote will execute automatically. If the quorum is less than the support required (e.g. 60% support with 40% quorum) then additional \"no\" votes could still stop the vote from being passed, so the vote will remain open until the duration is reached. After the vote ends, the result must be executed manually by one of the token holders in the organization. 2.2.3 Voting app The Voting app makes it easy for you to poll your fellow tokenholders about their position on an infinite range of topics. Votes initiated by other Aragon apps also show up in the Voting app. For example, assigning tokens using the Token Manager or moving funds from the Finance app are each actions that require a vote by tokenholders in a Democracy organization. Follow these steps to create a new vote and poll your community about a topic you care about: 2.2.3.1 Click \u201cNew Vote\u201d Fill out the question you want to poll your community about and click \u201cBegin Vote\u201d. 2.2.3.2 Sign transaction to create new vote Click the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button, then open your MetaMask wallet to sign and send the transaction. 2.2.3.3 Ask the other tokenholders to review and vote on the proposal Rally your fellow tokenholders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or good old fashioned face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal. Tokenholders can visit the Voting app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly. 2.2.3.4 Other tokenholders cast their vote In this case, the other tokenholder in the organization supports deploying the organization to mainnet. They sent a follow-up email saying that security audit came back with good results, so they will vote \u201cyes\u201d. 2.2.3.5 Review the vote Since there are only two token-holders in this organization, and the Support parameter is set to 51%, the unanimous vote on the question of whether or not the organization should be deployed to mainnet next week has resulted in an approved (or \u201cExecuted\u201d) vote. A vote with a status of \u201cExecuted\u201d does not need any further action to be taken. 2.2.4 Settings app The Settings app is where you can find the internal addresses for your organization, as well as troubleshoot issues you are having with Aragon. If you want to send ETH or tokens to your organization, make sure to use the Finance app address. When using testnet you also have the ability to request test tokens, which will be sent to the organization\u2019s Finance app. 2.2.5 Finance app The Finance app is the app that provides tokenholders with access to the funds held by their organization. The Finance app shows the current balance in ETH and tokens as well as the transaction history of the organization. You can also use the Finance app to initiate a new transfer of funds. Follow these steps to create a new transfer from the Finance app: 2.2.5.1 Send ETH or tokens to your organization On mainnet Go to the Finance app and click the \u201cNew Transfer\u201d button. On the \u201cDeposit\u201d tab, enter the token you want to deposit, the amount, and an optional reference note. Click \u201cSubmit deposit\u201d to complete the transfer. About a minute or so after your transaction is confirmed, the funds will appear in the Finance app of your organization. You can then create a new transfer to withdraw these funds to another address. On testnet Go to the Settings app and press the \u201cRequest test tokens\u201d button. Open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction. About a minute or so after your transaction is confirmed, test tokens will be sent to the Finance app address of your organization. You can then create a new transfer to send these tokens to another address. 2.2.5.2 Click \u201cNew Transfer\u201d to initiate a new transfer from the Finance app Go to the \"Withdrawal\" tab then enter the address of the recipient and the amount of tokens to send them, along with an optional reference note about what the transfer is for. Then click \u201cSubmit Transfer\u201d. 2.2.5.3 Sign the transaction to create the New Transfer vote As mentioned before, all actions in the Democracy organization require a vote by tokenholders. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d then open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction that creates the New Transfer vote. 2.2.5.4 Ask the other tokenholders in the organization to review and vote on the transfer The payment is intended to compensate another tokenholder in the organization for design work they did, so they waste no time reviewing and voting to approve the transfer. 2.2.5.5 The vote transaction is signed and sent to approve the transfer After confirmation, the transfer will execute. 2.2.5.6 Review the transfer in the Finance app Go back to the Finance app to see a record of the transfer and a link to the transaction record on the blockchain. 2.3 Create a Multisig organization 2.3.1 Navigate to https://app.aragon.org in your web browser Select which network you want to use to create your organization then click \"Create a new organization\". 2.3.2 Select \u201cToken project with Multisig\u201d then click \u201cNext\u201d A \u201cToken project with Multisig\u201d is an organization where the resources of the organization are controlled by m-of-n members of a multisig contract, where n is 100% of tokenholders and m is the Min. Quorum percentage of tokenholders that must approve a vote for it to pass. For example, in a 2-of-2 multisig DAO, two signatures from two different specified accounts are required for a proposal to pass. If more tokens are minted for additional accounts, then the number of signatures required may increase as well to maintain the required Min. Quorum. For example, starting with a 2-of-3 multisig (66% Min. Quorum) and issuing one token to a new account will make the DAO a 3-of-4 multisig, issuing one more token to yet another new account will make the DAO a 4-of-5 multisig, and so on. 2.3.3 Claim a domain name then click \u201cNext\u201d Aragon uses the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) to assign names to organizations. Note This name currently cannot be changed. 2.3.4 Enter the accounts and the parameters of the multisig contract First enter the addresses of the accounts that you want to be members of the multisig. Then set the number of signatures out of those accounts that will be required to approve votes in the multisig. For example, you can enter three accounts and require any two of their signatures to approve a vote (\u201c2-of-3\u201d). Up to six signers can be added during the organization creation process. If you need additional signers, you can add them after the organization is created by assigning a token to each of the accounts you want to join the organization. 2.3.5 Choose token name and symbol then click \u201cNext\u201d Note The token name and symbol currently cannot be changed. 2.3.6 Sign organization creation transactions Now you need to sign two transactions in MetaMask to create your organization. Open MetaMask if the wallet window does not open automatically. After the first transaction is confirmed, the second transaction may show up in MetaMask as a transaction with an \u201cunapproved\u201d label, indicating that it needs to be signed. Click the transaction to open and sign it. Note There is an issue with some Ethereum provider configurations that causes the browser window to crash and the organization creation process to fail after the first transaction, with no easy way to pick up where you left off to send the second and final transaction to create the organization. We are working on a fix for this specific issue that is causing the browser to crash, and we are also working on making it easier to recover from browser closures (due to a crash or otherwise) during the organization creation process in general. Please be advised that ETH used to pay gas for the first organization creation transaction will be \"stuck\" until we implement an easy way to recover and send the second and final organization creation transaction. 2.3.7 Click \u201cGet Started\u201d Your new Multisig organization is ready to go! 2.4 Explore the Multisig organization 2.4.1 Home app The Home app welcomes you to your organization and offers you several options for different actions you can take. You can also use the menu on the left-hand side of the screen to view the different apps that are currently installed for your organization. Aragon currently has the Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Permissions apps installed, with an App Center coming soon. 2.4.2 Token Manager app The Token Manager is the app you use to mint new tokens and assign them to other entities. You can mint new tokens by following these steps: 2.4.2.1 Click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d button Enter the address of the recipient of the tokens and the number of new tokens you want to mint and assign to that address, then click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d. Note Each tokenholder in a multisig organization can only hold one token at a time. An error will be shown and the transaction will fail if you attempt to mint additional tokens for existing tokenholders. 2.4.2.2 Create vote to assign tokens As mentioned before, in a Multisig organization m-of-n tokenholders are needed to approve every action. Click \u201cCreate transaction\u201d to create the transaction that creates a new vote to assign the new token you want to mint, then sign the transaction to create the vote. 2.4.2.3 Review the proposal and decide which way you want to vote After you have created the proposal to assign the token, you need to cast your vote for the proposal. Open the Voting app and review the proposal. Vote \u201cyes\u201d if you want to approve the proposal or \u201cno\u201d if you want to reject the proposal. 2.4.2.4 Create and sign the vote transaction After you have decided which way you want to vote, you need to create and sign the vote transaction. Review the details, click the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button to create the transaction, then sign the transaction to confirm your vote. 2.4.2.5 Ask the other tokenholders to review and vote on the proposal Rally your fellow tokenholders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or good old fashioned face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal. Tokenholders can visit the Voting app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly. In this example, the other tokenholder in the organization is happy to add a new member. They sent a follow-up email saying that they'll vote \u201cyes\u201d right away. 2.4.2.6 Check out the newest member of your Multisig DAO After the other tokenholder votes to approve the proposal, go back to the Token Manager and see that the member you added is now in the list of tokenholders. 2.4.3 Voting app The voting app makes it easy for you to poll your fellow tokenholders about their position on an infinite range of topics. Votes initiated by other Aragon apps also show up in the Voting app. For example, assigning tokens using the Token Manager or moving funds from the Finance app are each actions that require a vote by tokenholders in a Multisig organization. Follow these steps to create a new vote and poll your community about a topic you care about: 2.4.3.1 Click \u201cNew Vote\u201d Fill out the question you want to poll your community about and click \u201cBegin Vote\u201d. 2.4.3.2 Sign transaction to create new vote Click the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button, then open your MetaMask wallet to sign and confirm the transaction. 2.4.3.3 Review the proposal and decide which way you want to vote After you have created the proposal, you need to cast your vote for the proposal. Open the Voting app and review the proposal. Vote \u201cyes\u201d if you want to approve the proposal or \u201cno\u201d if you want to reject the proposal. 2.4.3.4 Create and sign the vote transaction After you have decided which way you want to vote, you need to create and sign the vote transaction. Review the details, click the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button to create the transaction, then sign the transaction to confirm your vote. 2.4.3.5 Ask the other tokenholders to review and vote on the proposal Rally your fellow tokenholders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or good old fashioned face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal. Tokenholders can visit the Voting app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly. 2.4.3.6 Review the vote Since three of three tokenholders are required to vote \u201cyes\u201d to approve a transaction, the unanimous vote on the question of whether or not the organization should sponsor the next AraCon has resulted in an approved (or \u201cExecuted\u201d) vote. A vote with a status of \u201cExecuted\u201d does not need any further action to be taken. 2.4.4 Settings app The Settings app is where you can find the internal addresses for your organization, as well as troubleshoot issues you are having with Aragon. If you want to send ETH or tokens to your organization, make sure to use the Finance app address. When using testnet you also have the ability to request test tokens, which will be sent to the organization\u2019s Finance app. 2.4.5 Finance app The Finance app is the app that provides tokenholders with access to the funds held by their organization. The Finance app shows the current balance in ETH and tokens as well as the transaction history of the organization. You can also use the Finance app to initiate a new transfer of funds. Follow these steps to create a new transfer from the Finance app: 2.4.5.1 Send ETH or tokens to your organization On mainnet Go to the Finance app and click the \u201cNew Transfer\u201d button.

About a minute or so after your transaction is confirmed, test tokens will be sent to the Finance app address of your organization. You can then create a new transfer to send these tokens to another address. 2.4.5.2 Click \u201cNew Transfer\u201d to initiate a new transfer from the Finance app Go to the \"Withdrawal\" tab, the enter the address of the recipient and the amount of tokens to send them, along with an optional reference note about what the transfer is for. Then click \u201cSubmit Transfer\u201d. 2.4.5.3 Sign the transaction to create the New Transfer vote As mentioned before, all actions in the Multisig organization require a vote by tokenholders. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d then open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction that creates the New Transfer vote. 2.4.2.4 Review the proposal and decide which way you want to vote After you have created the proposal to transfer the ETH, you need to cast your vote for the proposal. Open the Voting app and review the proposal. Vote \u201cyes\u201d if you want to approve the proposal or \u201cno\u201d if you want to reject the proposal. 2.4.2.5 Create and sign the vote transaction After you have decided which way you want to vote, you need to create and sign the vote transaction. Review the details, click the \u201cCreate transaction\u201d button to create the transaction, then sign the transaction to confirm your vote. 2.4.5.6 Ask the other tokenholders in the organization to review and vote on the transfer The payment is intended to compensate another tokenholder in the organization for documentation work they did, so they waste no time reviewing and voting to approve the transfer. The third tokenholder votes as well. After confirmation, the vote will execute and the transfer will be made. 2.4.5.8 Review the transfer in the Finance app Go back to the Finance app to see a record of the transfer and a link to the transaction record on the blockchain. 3. Aragon apps As mentioned in the earlier section 0.1 Anatomy of an Aragon organization , Aragon organizations have the ability to extend their functionality using Aragon apps. The apps that come pre-installed with Democracy and Multisig organizations are: Token Manager Voting Finance Permissions There is also a Home page, an Apps page, and a Settings page that every Aragon organization comes with by default. In this section we will explore each of these in detail. 3.1 Home The Home page is a simple landing page that shows you the name of the organization you have loaded, as well as different actions that you can take using the pre-installed apps in your organization. For example, in the organization democracy.aragonid.eth we can perform the actions Assign Tokens, Vote, Check Finance, and New Payment. You can also check your network connection status at the bottom of the Home page. 3.2 Token Manager The Token Manager is the app that is used to manage membership and voting power in an organization. To add members to an organization, it\u2019s as easy as minting and assigning a token to them. With the Democracy template, one token equals one vote, and members can hold as many tokens as are issued to them. With the Multisig template, one token also equals one vote but members cannot hold more than one token each. This simple process for managing membership and voting power provides the foundation for governing the resources of an organization. 3.2.1 Holders In the Holders section of the Token Manager app you can see the current list of tokenholders and the balance of organization tokens they each hold. Clicking on the dropdown menu on one of the rows in the list will provide you options for assigning more tokens to that tokenholder or removing tokens from the tokenholder. 3.2.2 Token Info In the Token Info section you can see information about the token that is used for governance in your organization: Token supply: how many tokens have been minted in total Transferable: whether or not the token can be transferred to another entity after it has been assigned Token: the token name and token symbol 3.2.3 Ownership Distribution In the Ownership Distribution section you can see which entities own what percent of the organization\u2019s token supply. This can be helpful as a spot check to see how token ownership is concentrated in the organization. 3.2.4 Assign Tokens If you click the Assign Tokens button, a panel will open up with text fields for entering the address of the entity you want to assign tokens to and how many tokens you want to assign. After you enter this information, you can click the \u201cAssign tokens\u201d button in the panel to finish completing the action. 3.3 Voting The Voting app is where you can see all open and past votes. You can also use the Voting app to start a new vote and poll tokenholders in the organization about an issue that is important to you. 3.3.1 Open votes The \u201cOpen votes\u201d section shows how many open votes there are and cards for each of the open votes, which show how much time is left in the vote, the number of the vote, a snippet of the issue being voted on, and the current status of the vote. You can click \u201cview vote\u201d to expand the card and either cast you vote if you have not voted yet or change your vote if you have already voted. Open votes - vote not cast Open votes - vote already cast In each case, the \u201cView vote\u201d panel tells you more detailed information about the status of a vote, such as: Time remaining: how much time is left until the vote closes, should no other votes cast cause the vote to automatically pass. Total support: what percent of the total token supply is needed to vote \u201cyes\u201d for the vote to be valid, and what percent of the total token supply has voted \u201cyes\u201d so far. The question being voted on. What entity created the vote. Current votes: what percent of voters are required to vote \u201cyes\u201d for the vote to pass, what percent of voters and how many tokens have voted \u201cyes\u201d, and what percent of voters and how many tokens have voted \u201cno\u201d. If you have not yet cast your vote, buttons for voting \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. If you have already voted, a button for changing your vote. How much voting power your vote will have based on your token balance at the beginning of the vote, along with a link to the block that the vote snapshot was taken from. 3.3.2 Past votes The \u201cPast votes\u201d section shows how many past votes there have been as well as cards for each of the past votes. Each card shows the date of the past vote, the number of the vote, a snippet of the issue being voted on, and the outcome of the vote. Clicking on the \u201cView vote\u201d button will then show you more detailed information about the vote. See the previous section 3.3.1 for a detailed explanation of the information in the \u201cView vote\u201d panel. 3.3.3 New vote If there is an important question you have that you want to poll tokenholders in the organization about, you can click the \u201cNew vote\u201d button to start a new vote. These votes are purely informative and will not directly result in any further action being taken in the organization. After you have filled out the text field in the \u201cNew vote\u201d panel with the question you want to ask, you can click \u201cBegin vote\u201d to complete the action and create a new vote if you have permission. 3.4 Finance The Finance app is used to manage the financial resources of an organization. You can see the balance of each asset the organization owns, a history of past transfers, and also create new transfers from the Finance app. 3.4.1 Token Balances The Token Balances section shows you the balance of each token owned by the organization. 3.4.2 Transfers The Transfers section shows you a history of past transfers that have been made using the Finance app, including information about the date of the transfer, what address the transfer was to or from, a reference with additional context about the transfer, and the amount of the transfer. The transfer history can be filtered by token: Or transfer type: And for each transfer, you can click on the drop down menu to get a link to view the transaction on the blockchain so you can see even more detail about the transfer: 3.4.3 New Transfer To send funds to your organization, you can create a deposit using the Finance app. Click the \"New Transfer\" button, open the \"Deposit\" tab, select the token you want to deposit, enter the amount and an optional reference note, then click the \"Submit deposit\" button. Note For non-ETH tokens, two transactions may be required to make a deposit. The first transaction approves the Finance app to pull the deposit amount from your account balance, and the second transaction is the actual deposit transaction. This is a safety feature to prevent the Finance app from pulling more funds from your account than you have explicitly authorized. To create a new transfer from your organization to another address, you can create a withdrawal using the Finance app. Click the \u201cNew Transfer\u201d button, open the \"Withdrawal\" tab, then enter the address you want to make the transfer to, what token you want to send, and the amount of tokens you want to send. You can optionally add a reference note to provide more context for the transfer. Once you have filled out all of this information you can click the \u201cSubmit transfer\u201d button to complete the action, if you have permission. 3.5 Permissions The Permissions app is used to view all of the current permissions that have been set in an organization and add or remove permissions as needed. The permissions set by the Permissions app define which entities have what permissions to perform various actions in an organization. For example, any account may have permission to create a vote but only tokenholders in an organization may have permission to cast a vote. 3.5.1 Browse by app The Permissions app shows a list of every app installed in the organization and the address or token symbol of that app. Every app has a list of actions that can be performed on the app, a list of actions that other entities have been given permission to perform on the app, and a list of permissions that the app has been granted. 3.5.1.1 Actions available on this app The \u201cActions available on this app\u201d section shows what actions can be performed on the app and which entity manages each action. This entity is called a \u201cmanager\u201d. A manager has the ability to choose which entities have permission to perform an action and the ability to change the manager of that action. If a manager removes themself as a manager of a permission without re-assigning the manager role to another entity, then management of that action defaults to whichever entity manages the \u201cCreate permissions\u201d action in the ACL app. If the manager of an action is set as 0xFFfFfFffFFfffFFfFFfFFFFFffFFFffffFfFFFfF then no new manager can be set and permissions granted for that action will be locked forever. If an action has not been given a manager yet, then it must be initialized. To initialize an action, enter the address of the entity that you want to manage the action, select which entity you want to grant permission to perform the action, then click the \u201cInitialize permission\u201d button to initialize the permission, if you have permission to do so. 3.5.1.2 Permissions set on this app The \u201cPermissions set on this app\u201d section shows which entities have permission to perform which actions on the app. If you are the manager of an action then you can revoke permission from any entity that has been granted permission to perform an action. 3.5.1.3 Permissions granted to this app The \u201cPermissions granted\u201d or \u201cPermissions granted to this app\u201d section shows which actions the entity has been granted to perform on which app. If you are the manager of an action in this section then you can revoke permission from the entity that has been granted permission to perform the action. 3.5.2 Browse by entity Back on the main Permissions page, you have the ability to get an at-a-glance view of all of the permissions set in an organization in the \u201cBrowse by entity\u201d section. Here, you can quickly see which entities have been granted permission to perform which actions in the organization. Clicking \u201cView details\u201d will take you to the permissions page for that entity. 3.5.3 Add permission To give permission to an entity to perform an action on an app, click the \u201cAdd permission\u201d button, select which app you want the entity to perform the action on, select which entity you want to grant the permission to, then select the action you want to grant the entity permission to perform. Each app has different actions that an entity can be granted permission to perform. Granting permission to an entity to perform these actions on these apps will allow them to: ACL Create permissions: create permissions in any app that uses this ACL instance * * These actions are very sensitive actions that will give the entity with permission to perform these actions almost complete control of your organization. EVM Script Registry Add executors: add an executor to the organization * Enable and disable executors: enable and disable executors in an organization * An executor is an interpreter for running scripts in an organization. All of the apps in an organization use the executors in the organization to execute scripts that are part of transactions sent to the app. Each script has an identifier that determines which executor is used for running the script. For example, whenever a vote transaction is sent to the Voting app, the app runs a script, then uses an executor to execute the script in the transaction. You can find more documentation about executors in the Aragon Developer Portal . * These actions are very sensitive actions that will give the entity with permission to perform these actions almost complete control of your organization. Kernel Manage apps: install apps, upgrade apps, and change default apps in an organization. The ACL and the EVM Script Registry are default apps in the organization. Whoever has permission to perform this action can also change the default Vault app of the organization (which is the Vault that tokens will be sent to if tokens are sent to the address of an app that is not meant to accept token deposits). * * These actions are very sensitive actions that will give the entity with permission to perform these actions almost complete control of your organization. Token Manager Assign tokens: mint and assign the specified number of tokens to the specified entity Revoke vesting: revoke token vesting from the specified entity Mint tokens: mint tokens and transfer them to the organization\u2019s Vault app Voting Modify quorum: modify the Min. Quorum parameter Create new votes: create a new vote Modify support: modify the Support parameter \u201cMin. Quorum\u201d is short for \u201cMinimum Acceptance Quorum. \u201cMin. Quorum\u201d is the number for what percent of the total outstanding supply of token must approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. For example, if the Min. Quorum is set to 20%, then 20% of the outstanding token supply must vote to approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. If a vote does not make quorum, then it will fail, even if more tokens voted to approve the proposal than voted against it. For example, if the Min. Quorum is set to 20% and 10% of the outstanding token supply votes against the proposal but only 15% vote in support, then the proposal will fail because it has not reached the Min. Quorum threshold. \u201cSupport\u201d is the number for what percent of the tokens that participated in a vote must approve a proposal for that proposal to pass. For example, if \u201cSupport\u201d is set to 51%, then 51% of tokens that vote on a proposal must approve the proposal for it to pass. Finance Create new payments: create a transfer from the Finance app to another entity Execute payments: trigger a recurring payment owed to an entity Disable payments: enable and disable recurring payments Vault Transfer Vault\u2019s tokens: transfer tokens in the Vault app 3.6 Apps The Apps page is not an app yet but shows other apps that are currently in development. In the future, this page will be an app that you can use to browse and install apps that are available to be installed in your organization. 3.7 Settings The Settings page has information about your organization, including the addresses of the installed app and the network addresses of the Ethereum and IPFS nodes your Aragon client is connected to. There is also a button that can help you troubleshoot any issues you are experiencing with your Aragon client. If you are using Aragon on testnet, you can also request test tokens from the Settings page. These tokens will be deposited into your organization\u2019s Finance app. Do not send non-ETH tokens to the organization's Finance app address. If you want to send non-ETH tokens to your organization, you must follow the instructions for making a deposit . 4. Troubleshooting If your browser closes after signing the first transaction to create your organization but before the second transaction appears in your Ethereum provider Leave a message in the Aragon Chat #feedback channel describing what happened. At their soonest availability, someone from the Aragon development team will then help you create, sign, and broadcast the second transaction. If you are having trouble performing an action that you expect you should be able to perform Make sure your Ethereum provider is unlocked, on the correct network, and open to the correct account. Try the action again, and if it still doesn\u2019t work... If there is a \"Privacy mode\" enabled in the settings of your Ethereum provider, disable it. Try the action again, and if it still doesn't work... Reload the page in your browser. Try the action again, and if it still doesn\u2019t work... Go to the Settings page and click the \u201cClear application cache\u201d button. Try the action again, and if it still doesn\u2019t work... Check the connection status in the Home app of your organization. It should say \u201cConnected to the network\u201d. Try the action again, and if it still doesn\u2019t work... Make sure your computer is properly connected to the internet. Try the action again, and if it still doesn\u2019t work... Search the issues in the Aragon GitHub repository to see if your issue has already been reported. If you do not find an issue that matches your issue, create a new issue or leave a message in the Aragon Chat #feedback channel describing the issue.","title":"Aragon User Guide"},{"location":"tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#aragon-user-guide","text":"Documentation Version 1.0.6 Aragon Version 0.6 Read more about Aragon 0.6, named Alba, in the Aragon 0.6 is live on Mainnet blog post.","title":"Aragon User Guide"},{"location":"tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#0-introduction","text":"Aragon is an application for creating and governing organizations - such as clubs, corporations, nonprofits, and open source projects - on Ethereum -compatible blockchain networks.

Introduction"},{"location":"tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#01-anatomy-of-an-aragon-organization","text":"An Aragon organization is made up of software programs known as \u201csmart contracts\u201d. While traditional legal contracts are ultimately enforced by coercion and the ability to physically seize assets in case one party to the contract does not fulfill their obligations, smart contracts are enforced by computers that ensure the contract is executed exactly as it is programmed. This \u201cself-enforcing\u201d property of smart contracts can reduce the risk involved in certain types of contracts. The smart contract system Aragon is built on is called aragonOS . This system ensures that only authorized accounts and contracts (what Aragon refers to as \u201centities\u201d) have permission to perform specific actions in an organization. The same way that a legal contract defines what rights and obligations a party to the contract has, the aragonOS smart contracts define what rights and obligations entities have in an Aragon organization. Each Aragon organization has apps that can be \u201cinstalled\u201d on aragonOS. These apps extend the functionality of the organization and give members new ways of interacting with each other and the organization itself. Some examples of applications that can be added to Aragon organizations are the Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Permissions apps. Anyone can develop their own app, add it to their own organization, and publish it for others to use as well. Note You can find more information about the technical details of how Aragon works, including how to develop your own Aragon app, in the Aragon Developer Portal .","title":"0.1 Anatomy of an Aragon organization"},{"location":"tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#1-prerequisites","text":"In addition to a working laptop or desktop computer with a decent internet connection, you will need the following to start using Aragon: Up-to-date Brave , Chrome / Chromium , Firefox , or Opera web browser. An Ethereum provider such as MetaMask and a compatible Ethereum wallet such as Ledger or Trezor if your Ethereum provider either does not have key management (\"wallet\") functionality built-in or you prefer not to use the built-in wallet functionality. If you are using Aragon on mainnet, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Main Ethereum Network. You will then need to load your wallet with enough ETH to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. ETH can be acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange that lists ETH. As a rough estimate of how much ETH you should start with, multiply 20,000,000 times the current \u201cstandard\u201d gas price times 0.000000001 to find out how much ETH you need. For example, at a current standard gas price of 10 gwei, you should start with 0.2 ETH. If you are using Aragon on testnet, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Rinkeby Test Network. You will then need to load your wallet with test ether for the Ethereum Rinkeby test network. This test ether is used to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. You can try the Rinkeby faucet or post your Ethereum Rinkeby testnet address in the #faucet channel on Aragon Chat to receive test ether for free.

Hey there fellow creators! This post aims to be a resource for anyone who wants to set up any kind of organization using Aragon\u2019s technology, which released its beta just a few days ago . It\u2019s supposed to function as a workshop in which creators find the initial guidance necessary to start experimenting with the possibilities of DAOs, the new kind of digital organizations! The style of the guidelines that follow is very basic: someone with pretty much no knowledge of cryptocurrencies or Ethereum should get a solid understanding of the mechanics on how to create a DAO on top of Aragon following 3 simple steps. Aragon\u2019s beta version is now live on the Rinkeby Testnet, and here we\u2019ll talk about that version (Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect). For future deploys, we\u2019ll make additional posts. The Basics What is a DAO? DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is an organization built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, a set of smart contracts that allow for organizations to operate following new governance models that will make even Silicon Valley startups seem traditional . I wrote more deeply about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations' nature here . Benefits of a DAO Can\u2019t be censored Programmable governance modules for different organization models Tokens easily and transparently distributed Operates under a digital jurisdiction in our current digital era No central power can be corrupted Easier to attract talent around the globe to contribute to the organization\u2019s mission Various entities: people, other orgs, software\u2026 Transparent transactions ... many more! What does Aragon do? Aragon does many useful things! First and foremost, Aragon provides simple software for the setup of any organization . Within a few clicks and very little cost, you can start running a digital organization. Sounds good huh? It also provides a digital jurisdiction for governance and dispute resolution: the Aragon Network . To understand Aragon\u2019s mission in the crypto DAO space, you can check a little post I made about it, or watch an awesome video released by the team! The Aragon Mission Empowering unstoppable organizations through freedom of collaboration Getting Started So, you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re creating an organization in 21st century fashion? Awesome! Let\u2019s dive into the 3 simple steps you have to follow to get started using the software that will facilitate the organization\u2019s operations from now on. \ud83c\udf7c Step 1: basic Ethereum tools We\u2019ll take for granted you know a little bit about what a blockchain is and what Ethereum does (if not, there\u2019s plenty of information online for you to dive into). Yet, some tools and terms might seem confusing, so we\u2019ll outline some very easy to follow definitions about key tools that you must know to set up a DAO. Ether : Ethereum\u2019s currency/token. The fees to set up the organization, vote, etc. will be paid in ether. (Rinkeby) Testnet : Ethereum network built for testing purposes where the ether transacted is virtual; doesn\u2019t hold real value . Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect is deployed on this testnet. To get faucet funds for the Rinkeby Testnet, follow this link . MetaMask is a browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum Dapps (like Aragon) directly from Chrome, Firefox or Brave. More info and installation help can be found here . Etherscan allows you to explore and search the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Ethereum. Aragon 0.5 will point us to Etherscan when we want to check transaction history of the apps, and some other activities we\u2019ll see now. \ud83d\udc23 Step 2: create the DAO Ready to create your DAO? Visit aragon.one and click on the blue button on the top right corner that says \u201cTry Aragon Core 0.5\u201d. That will open up a very intuitive initial menu where you must provide the basic infrastructure of your organization. First, you will have to choose between using Democracy or Multisig for your Token project. Multisig is still very early in the making and has pretty much no utility at the moment, so we\u2019ll move forward with Democracy. Second, you must claim a domain name in _____. aragonid.eth fashion. We chose workshop.aragonid.eth, as shown below, and clicked Next. Third, we must choose 3 metrics for our Democracy project. They are Support (%), Minimum Quorum (%) and Vote Duration (time). Support is the % of votes an outcome must get to be a winning outcome (in this case, we chose a simple 50% majority). Min.Quorum is the minimum % of token holders that must participate for the vote to be accepted, for which we chose 23% as an example (Min.Quorum can be a bit confusing specially for small organizations: we\u2019ll take a deeper look later when working with the Voting app). Vote Duration represents the time a vote is open; we chose 72 hours. Next, we have to choose the name and symbol for our DAO\u2019s token. We wrote AWK as the ticker. Finally, we must sign two transactions (Token Creation and Organization Creation) with our MetaMask wallet. Testnet price to set up the DAO was ~$50 at the time of the experiment, which depends mostly on the Ethereum Network fees. Remember, it\u2019s virtual ether for now! Clicking twice on Submit (green button) should finish the process, and you should get a message like the one below. Congratulations! Your DAO is ready. Let\u2019s click on Get Started! When we click on the blue Get Started button, we are entering our Aragon DAO for the first time. Exciting! The homepage should present us with four functions regarding the 3 apps available. We\u2019ll now take a deeper look into each one of those. P.S. This is the creation process for a DAO on Aragon. To enter the DAO afterwards, we must simply open it after clicking \u201cTry Aragon Core 0.5\u201d on aragon.one by entering its name and clicking on \u201cOpen organization\u201d, as shown below. \ud83d\udcce Step 3: use the apps you need Now that we\u2019ve set up our DAO, we can use the three apps available (for now). They are Token Manager, Voting and Finance, and we\u2019ll also look at the DAO\u2019s settings. They all can be accessed by clicking on the menu at the left of the screen. \ud83d\udcca Token Manager The Token Manager lets you distribute your organization\u2019s tokens amongst stakeholders. At first, the MetaMask wallet address you used for the creation of the DAO will own 100% of the tokens. To assign tokens to other DAO members, click on the blue button at the top right corner that says \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d. There, you must provide a valid Ethereum Address for the Recipient of the tokens, and the number of tokens you want to mint. We have chosen to mint 0.1 tokens for the address below. This action will inherently open a vote about the decision to mint the tokens, with your vote in favor. Since you\u2019ll be the only token holder at the moment, the vote will automatically close with a Yes. You\u2019ll have to sign the transaction using MetaMask. After assigning tokens to a couple of addresses, your Token Manager should look somewhat like this (check total token distribution at the right of the screen): For a more technical description of the Token Manager, see here . \u270b Voting The Voting app is an entity that will execute a set of actions on other entities if token holders of the DAO decide to do so. To open up a new vote, click on the top right corner \u201cNew Vote\u201d button. Then, we must simply state what the vote is for, and click on Begin Vote. You\u2019ll have to confirm the transaction through MetaMask (it\u2019ll open itself automatically). To see the details of a certain vote, you can click on View Vote at the right of the screen. It should open up a dashboard like the one below. Remember that you have to be a token holder to be able to participate in a vote in a certain DAO. There, we have the Status of the vote, the Quorum (this is set when setting up the DAO), the Question, its creator, and the current results. In the Workshop\u2019s case, I am holder of 76% of the DAO\u2019s tokens, so as soon as I voted on something (you automatically vote Yes when creating a vote) the vote was closed (as seen in the screenshot). This was confusing at first, but makes sense mathematically; Quorum and Support were met as soon as I voted! I would recommend to keep this in mind when allocating tokens for testing purposes with your fellow creators or partners, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to really try out Voting. For a more technical description of the Voting app, see here . \ud83d\udcb0 Finance The purpose of the Finance app is keeping track of income and expenses in your organization, as well as performing payments. At first, your finances will look somewhat empty, as the DAO holds no funds of her own yet. You can use your MetaMask wallet to send some funds to the DAO, or use some other Rinkeby options available for fund transfer. The address to use will be specified later, in the Settings section. In our case, we sent 0.9 to the DAO, which show up in the panel after the transaction takes place in the Ethereum network (you must wait a bit). Now that the DAO owns funds, you can perform payments by clicking on the \u201cNew Transfer\u201d button on the top right corner. Then, you must choose the Recipient\u2019s address, the amount of tokens and the token (ETH, ANT\u2026) in which you want to send the payment, and add a Reference (short phrase) to identify it. It will be sent by clicking on Submit Transfer. For a more technical description of the Finance app, see here . \ud83d\udd29 Settings You can find the Organization\u2019s and the Apps\u2019 addresses in the Settings tab. You should not send funds to the DAO by transacting with the Organization\u2019s address! I made this mistake and wasted a bit of my time, I guess. Good warning Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect operates on Rinkeby\u2019s Testnet, so you can request test tokens by clicking that option on your DAO\u2019s settings, as seen above, and that will send some test tokens for the DAO to play with. You can also send tokens directly to the Finance app of the DAO, which has its own address. Either way, the funds will appear on the Finance tab shortly after. The Token Manager and the Voting app of your DAO also have their own addresses, and their updates can be checked on Etherscan. Below are the recorded transactions of our Workshop\u2019s Voting app. To check out more info about the current and future Aragon apps, visit the wiki . \ud83d\udc99 Bonus Step: enjoy the journey! These are the basic things you need to know to set up and operate a DAO with Aragon\u2019s current software. Now it\u2019s time to have fun! The team is always active in the community chat , so for any further doubts it\u2019s a good idea to reach @light or @tatu there; they\u2019ll quickly help you solve your problems. Some questions were recurring in the chat and social media, so I thought I\u2019d contribute with an explanatory post summarizing the 3 initial steps for anyone to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

It\u2019s supposed to function as a workshop in which creators find the initial guidance necessary to start experimenting with the possibilities of DAOs, the new kind of digital organizations! The style of the guidelines that follow is very basic: someone with pretty much no knowledge of cryptocurrencies or Ethereum should get a solid understanding of the mechanics on how to create a DAO on top of Aragon following 3 simple steps. Aragon\u2019s beta version is now live on the Rinkeby Testnet, and here we\u2019ll talk about that version (Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect).

MetaMask is a browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum Dapps (like Aragon) directly from Chrome, Firefox or Brave. More info and installation help can be found here . Etherscan allows you to explore and search the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Ethereum.

Brett: hack.aragon.org probably the most accessible place. If we had a table on page there it would be quite useful. Libraries.io sends email updates when new versions are released; could be used to keep track of when we should update this table assuming we do a good job of only making breaking changes on major versions","title":"Notes"},{"location":"videos/meeting_notes/all_aragon_devs/alldevs20181022/#license","text":"This template is borrowed from the Ethereum All Core Devs call notes template and inherits the same CC-BY-SA 3.0 License .","title":"License"},{"location":"videos/meeting_notes/all_aragon_devs/alldevs20181105/","text":"All Core Devs Meeting #9 Meeting Date/Time: 2019/11/05 at 16:00 UTC Agenda Aragon One updates from last call and current priorities (~5-10min) Launched to mainnet! 50 DAOs so far, 20 are probably ours :-D Rinkeby was redeployed, 0.6 version aragonOS 4 lots of activity Lorikeet was announced at Devcon :-D Still a lot of work to be done Will be moving a lot of components from aragon-ui to lorikeet AGP1 is happening!!! :-D Processes for how we do governance over the protocol.

Dev-tooling channel should be made for bugs and CLI Protofire payroll app updates Feature complete with milestone 4 Ready to start milestone 5 (mostly development-related tasks, like cleaning things up, moving components into aragonUI, etc) We would like to stay engaged, and are looking at other design issues, EPICs, tasks, etc to work on. Looking for tasks and suggestions for things to work on. We are a little bit raw and are missing easy things to pass along Documenting how releases are done per repo/package Release ownership Npm usernames coming from DAC (Quazia, Daniel, and ?) We want to document this more explicitly per package/per repo DAC will be working on JS and CLI so that\u2019s probably the best place to prioritize for the DAC What do we test every time we do a release? If the provider starts to come together, then this will become a package Who can create repos? Anyone who is part of the NPM org can do it. Should we add the DAC to this? Hell yeah! We can add one DAC person as an admin and they can add the rest. For npm updates, we should have a dev updates channel! Griff to follow up with Kay to see if we can make a npm package update channel ETHSingapore More core infrastructure rather than dapps Three groups tried, one turned into a nest proposal Slicing pie; equity manager for members Status extension to create a room for the DAO and create votes / send votes in the room through chat commands YachtDAO; vote on where the yacht would go, what they would spend money on, etc Really successful decentralized office hours on rocket.chat ETHDenver upcoming in Feb.

Keybase or Rocketchat? Bridge to Riot In the end it doesn\u2019t really matter Brett to talk to John to make DMs more open Telegram is a scammer\u2019s paradise We should have a telegram announcement There\u2019s a forum post on this, we should get John and Griff involved there https://forum.aragon.org/t/do-you-manage-the-telegram-groups-aragon-official-aragon-annoucement/343/3 Griff and Chris will figure out a team bridge channel The existing dev channels can be used for this. Dev-tooling channel should be made for bugs and CLI Protofire payroll app updates Feature complete with milestone 4 Ready to start milestone 5 (mostly development-related tasks, like cleaning things up, moving components into aragonUI, etc) We would like to stay engaged, and are looking at other design issues, EPICs, tasks, etc to work on. Looking for tasks and suggestions for things to work on. We are a little bit raw and are missing easy things to pass along Documenting how releases are done per repo/package Release ownership Npm usernames coming from DAC (Quazia, Daniel, and ?) We want to document this more explicitly per package/per repo DAC will be working on JS and CLI so that\u2019s probably the best place to prioritize for the DAC What do we test every time we do a release? If the provider starts to come together, then this will become a package Who can create repos? Anyone who is part of the NPM org can do it. Should we add the DAC to this? Hell yeah! We can add one DAC person as an admin and they can add the rest. For npm updates, we should have a dev updates channel! Griff to follow up with Kay to see if we can make a npm package update channel ETHSingapore More core infrastructure rather than dapps Three groups tried, one turned into a nest proposal Slicing pie; equity manager for members Status extension to create a room for the DAO and create votes / send votes in the room through chat commands YachtDAO; vote on where the yacht would go, what they would spend money on, etc Really successful decentralized office hours on rocket.chat ETHDenver upcoming in Feb. Bigger not eth focused hackathons might be a better opportunity Maybe by March there might be an event to work with These are good lists https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2019/events https://devpost.com/hackathons A digital hackathon might be an option as well Will explore more. Naming is still happening\u2026 Renaming for the Main Aragon App\u2026 we will call it the Aragon Client. @aragon/api Should it be app not api? The CLI is something people install If someone wanted to make a website for a DAO, they wouldnt need the API\u2026 they would just need the JS?

Updates Aragon One Finishing up loose ends for 0.7 Work on court Finalizing Payroll - soft launch for 0.7 - will add to the AGP18 Security partners pipeline aragonOS and payroll shoud be pinned be the end of the week. Finished up work for local identities and identity providers - not the entire spec yet, but there is local address book tagging ['local identity']. Will provide details on how to access staging and provide feedback. Court (Jorge). Published the mechanism and open sourced the repo. PoC mechanism almost there.getting appeals process finalized and testing strategy. Still thinking about the testing strategy. Autark On the way to Rinkeby Work on the Address Book. How to articulate Address Book and A1 Identity Provider? Work on responsive design. Will come on second deployment. Improve testing - in the next two weeks should be in a state to have e2e testing for all apps. Bug fixing and improvements in response to the reviews. Major work on Allocations app to change how we handle payouts. Increased the amount of dynamic informative text across all applications so users have a strong idea of what votes, and forwarded actions do. OWL Profiles - going forward with 3Box integration. Finalized plan to move their data structures to adhere to linked data standards. Started developing the Profiles solution this week. Discussions - Built a proof of concept IPFS backend caching layer. Aragon Mesh Updates to aragonCLI in previous two weeks: Add aragon ipfs view aragon ipfs propagate Renamed kits to templates Planned features for CLI extensions Merged react and react-kit boilerplates The react boilerplate now has linting and testing for the contracts set up, thanks to David from P2P models (who's working on the Aragon Wiki app) The react boilerplate app was updated (Pierre - Aragon One). Internal improvements: docs, sourcemaps, etc. Next two weeks goals: Finish WIP across some of the repos New package ipfs-commands for aragon-cli Create new guides for Frame and hopefully for the Agent app Authio (Alex dropped off call) ConsenSys Diligence The team added \u201cpending-security\u2013review\u201d labels (github) - clearly visualize the state of changes in terms of security review Expect there will at least be one comment in the PR that summaraizes efforts/findings Will add inline comments to LOC too Ongoing review - focus: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Apending-security-review Understanding the SDL working on proposal for next vote (sec partner) Idea to add a security-request label on github. Work on 0.7 Work on the draft of proposal for next AGP ballot Took efforts to better understand software development processes in Aragon. Earlier to get security review in processes, the cheaper it will be in the long run Initial findings - havent written a report yet - there are certain security and quality gates already implemented and they are going to suggest more security gates so its easier for new members and for other projects to trust the core system Announcements Aragon 0.7 on staging A1 maintains a staging environment on rinkeby Staging uses a separate ENS instance to the rinkeby release. That means staging DAOs are separate to rinkeby DAOs even though they're on the same network. Tries to deploy every 2 weeks to staging with new changes. Any time a new feature is merged or on the verge of merge, will deploy a staging build to test it out themselves and make it easier for others in the team to test. Not sure about publicizing all builds, but may be a way to get people more involved in testing Reach out if interested in testing the changes or if you know someone that wants to help. Latest version for local Identities and other changes for 0.7 published last week on staging. Pando Released pando on rinkeby last week. See forum post for details: https://forum.aragon.org/t/pando-live-on-rinkeby/712/5 There is a test DAO on rinkeby with onboarding guide on how to use pando. Pando cli is published on npm - anyone can use it and test it on rinkeby, can deploy a test DAO and see if everything is working Deployment process was almost easy except the IPFS aspect. ipfs-propogate command has been a great help There is a problem with the aragon dev chain. cannot publish on open.aragonpm.eth on the devchain The related issue . @aragon/api-react Release Announcement Stable release Pierre over the last few weeks has been working on react api on FE for apps. Using hooks,very modern as far as react exprience goes. It should help people it gradually get into the aragon API aspect of things for front end. Makes things a lot more explicit A1 has started using it internally and will be migrating most of their apps to use this api in the coming \"while\" Discussions Organization identity Widget approach - for a DAO to customize the information they want to include Ability to set a token defining membership. Maybe a more generic approach such as an ENS-based approach could make it to. Jorge: with ENS there are additional advantages. For example with melonport they have two types of members with different permissions. If you have one native token that will have to be the global Ability to create as many info blobs as the organization wants. Based on Markdown Vote-based process to update / change. Need the ability to add manifesto / important text for the DAO. It wont be stored on chain. Ability to create \"word blobs\" via widgets and markdown-based. Integrating a text editor - and ability to vote to change the data. Potentially this is something that could be managed completely by Pando repos. How does it stay on IPFS? Plans on using pinning service (pinata?) Right now using Infura bc they pin automatically but not a great long term solution. IPFS Consortium IPFS Cluster Jorge: for the court the organization needs written rules, manifesto, etc. so it is important for that. Would love to be involved in the process of how this gets done. Ability to provide specific informations about DAOs. Requirements for specific features ? Potential APIs Set a default token manager app Membership hook / abstraction layer in aragonAPI. E.g. as part of the settings \"I would like to use this app as my membership provider\" - then link to token manager for example Implement an app that only \"attaches\" (not \"manages\") a token, for its forwarding interface Aragon Trigger? Forum post soon 3Box API. Few questions / doubts from John: Wondering how they are implementing querying and how that scales Need a good way to identify and access as far as he knows, not an easy way to do that If you're using a backend caching layer each comment has a hash Wondering how their implementation under the hood is actually better than a centralized caching layer Wondering if they are spreading theirselves thin? 3box supposed to tackle identity/profiles They may be taking on too much by doing commenting as well Forwarding UX Improvements https://forum.aragon.org/t/showing-pending-forwarded-actions-in-apps/709 Allow apps to be aware that an action is pending in a forwarder (e.g. into the voting app). Other applications can display that something may potentially happen as a result of voting. eg. you are in finance app and create a new transfer. That creates a new vote, but finance app doesn't have knowledge of that action within the app. Decoding EVMScripts: Decoding will be the most interesting part of how this gets built Information needed to decode the script is probably more accesible in the receiving app vs target app Decoding in two layers: Decode to determine type of EVMScript, and superficial details (e.g. target address) Decode actual target calls via apps' ABIs Decoding is easier if you have only one \"interactive\" forwarder at the end of the path, but gets more complicated if there are more than one (e.g. voting - voting, voting - futarchy) UI standarization How much of the information would actually be acted upon int he UIs? Will the application determine which functions are relevant? For example maybe have a badge that displays if an action is protected by an auth guard Perhaps the auth information could be shown in the signing panel Auth information is likely important for other users, not just the creator, so useful in interactive forwarders' UIs too E.g. Voting app: it should be more clear that you will be interacting with a contract or not Could render components from other applications to show more specific information However, this would likely require another iframe to sandbox correctly (which is not nice) Security Requirements If you have any supporting links for high level doc, will be helpful for security partners so they can estimate their budget better for the AGP. Aragon One Completely new code - Full audit vs incremental Network components - court is fairly large contract with many edge cases Staking component - meant to be simple and self contained Bonding curve component - similar to staking. Holds value - lot of care needed. When people want to become jurors this is done with a bonding curve. Incremental change - perhaps a new app for the Aragon client - associated to this app will be a few changes to the Voting app. Controller for the Voting app - pause this vote, cancel this vote. Has specific functionality to enable court features. More details in the blog/forum post. As far as contracts for existing applications - hopefully they wont change hence no audits needed. If they do change it's because something went wrong. Autark Applications that will need full audits at some point: Allocations Range Voting Projects Address Book Rewards The urgency of these audits is not a major pressure currently, ideally we'd like to have these applications published to Mainnet before the end of the year Possible to do audit of each app seperately or in phases to distribute the effort Aragon Black Apiary The overall Apiary app is made of four contracts: the tap which is pretty simple. the pool which inherits the Agent app while adding the ability to add a list of guarded token and a safeExecute function checking that the target contract is not a guarded token + that the balance of each guarded token is kept constant before and after the transaction the bonding curve contract which is the tricky one. a wrapping Apiary contract behaving as an api contract on top of the three previous contracts to circumvent sandboxing limitations. The tricky part is gonna be the bonding curve contract. The pool contract tricky part is limited to the safeExecute function. The other ones are pretty straightforward and fast to audit I guess. The bonding curve is basically a BancorFormula contract (ideally we would need to review it too, though I guess Bancor contracts are already heavily reviewed) with batched orders to mitigate front running (plus AragonOS features like ACL and all of course). The network bonding curve may rely on this implementation so I may make sense to heavily review it :) Pando If we pass the next AGP ballot and Aragon Black becomes an official Aragon Team - and thus pando an official aragon app - it may makes sense to review the contracts too. Those are pretty simple and straightforward, though so it should not be that much work - an internal review may even be enough.
